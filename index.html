The <i>Ninety-Five Theses</i> are reproduced in their entirety.</p><p></p><h2>Callahan&#39;s Con (Callahan&#39;s Crosstime Saloon Series)</h2><p>The discreet little bar that Jake Stonebender established a few blocks below Duval Street was named simply The Place. There, Fast Eddie Costigan learned to curse back at parrots as he played the house piano; the Reverend Tom Hauptman learned to tend bar bare-chested (without blushing), Long-Drink McGonnigle discovered the margarita and several se�oritas, and all the other regulars settled into comfortable subtropical niches of their own. Nobody even noticed them save the universe.<br><br>Over time, the twice-transplanted patrons of Callahan&#x2019;s Place attracted a collection of local zanies so quintessentially Key West pixilated that they made the New York originals seem, well, almost normal. The elfin little Key deer, for instance--with a stevedore&#x2019;s mouth; or the merman with eczema; or Robert Heinlein&#x2019;s teleporting cat.<br><br>For ten slow, merry years, life was good. The sun shone, the coffee dripped, the breeze blew just strongly enough to dissipate the smell of the puns, and little supergenius Erin grew to the verge of adolescence. Then disaster struck. <br><br>Through the gate one sunny day came a malevolent, moronic, mastodon of a Mafioso named Tony Donuts Jr., or Little Nuts (don&#x2019;t ask). He&#x2019;d decided to resurrect the classic protection racket in Key West--and guess which tavern he picked to hit first? Then, thanks to very poor accessorizing (she chose the wrong belt--and no, we&#x2019;re not going to explain that one), Jake&#x2019;s wife, Zoey, suddenly found herself in a place with no light, no heat, and no air. And no way home. The urgent question was where--<i>precisely </i>where--but that turned out to be a problem so complex that even the entire gang, equipped with teleportation, time travel, and telepathic syntony (you can look it up) might not be able to crack it in time.<br><br>And while all this was going on, Death himself walked into The Place. But this time he would not leave alone. . . .<br></p><p><b>Raves for Spider Robinson</b><br><br>&#x201c;Spider Robinson is the hottest writer to hit science fiction since [Harlan] Ellison.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Spider Robinson&#x2019;s the antidote for entropy, the blahs, and the pernicious notion that humor and good grace are absent from the SF field.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ben Bova<br><br>&#x201c;Spider Robinson is the Tom Robbins of the 21st century.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John Varley<br><br>&#x201c;How the hell is any self-respecting author supposed to compete with a storyteller as good as Spider Robinson?&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David Gerrold<br><br>&#x201c;Robinson knows how to generate tension without losing his sense of humor, a more difficult trick than you might imagine.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><b>Spider Robinson</b>, winner of three Hugos and a Nebula, was born in the Bronx and raised on Long Island, and has been a Canadian resident for 30 years. Holder of a bachelor's degree in English from the State University of New York, he worked as a folksinger and journalist before publishing his first story in <i>Analog </i>in 1973. He now lives with his wife Jeanne Robinson (co-author of the Hugo- and Nebula-winning Stardance trilogy) on an island outside Vancouver, B.C., where they raise and exhibit hopes. <br><br>Eleven of his 31 books are set in Callahan's Place, a fabulous tavern founded by a time traveler, where puns flow as freely as beer, and smell far worse. The most recent is<i> Callahan's Con</i> [Tor July 2003]. He has contributed a regular editorial column, "Future Tense," to Canada's national newspaper,<i> The Globe &amp; Mail</i>, since 1995. In 2000, he released<i> </i>Belaboring the Obvious<i>, </i>a CD of original music with the legendary Amos Garrett ("Midnight at the Oasis") on lead guitar, and in 2001 he was a celebrity judge at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. <br></p><h2>Meridian Exercise for Self-Healing, Book 1: Classified by Common Symptoms</h2><p>A systematic series of exercises that relaxes and rejuvenates the mind and body.

Tour.</p><p>Scores of nineteenth-century expeditions battled savage cold, relentless ice and winter darkness in pursuit of two great prizes: the quest for the elusive Passage linking the Atlantic and the Pacific and the international race to reach the North Pole. Pierre Berton's #1 best-selling book brings to life the great explorers: the pious and ambitious Edward Parry, the flawed hero John Franklin, ruthless Robert Peary and the cool Norwegian Roald Amundsen. He also credits the Inuit, whose tracking and hunting skills saved the lives of the adventurers and their men countless times. <br> <br>These quests are peopled with remarkable figures full of passion and eccentricity. They include Charles Hall, an obscure printer who abandoned family and business to head to a frozen world of which he knew nothing; John Ross, whose naval career ended when he spotted a range of mountains that didn't exist; Frederick Cook, who faked reaching the North Pole; and Jane Franklin, who forced an expensive search for her missing husband upon a reluctant British government. <br> <br>Pierre Berton, who won his first Governor General's award for <i>The Mysterious North</i>, here again gives us an important and fascinating history that reads like a novel as he examines the historic events of the golden age of Arctic exploration.Culled from extensive research of handwritten diaries and private journals, Arctic Grail is the definitive book on the age of arctic exploration and adventure. Journey across the ice with a Who's Who of polar explorers, men of every temperament, including the pious and ambitious Edward Perry, the first explorer to probe deep into the Arctic labyrinth; Adolphus Greely, a Civil War veteran who had to watch his men starve to death on Ellesmere Island; Robert McClure, who claimed that he was the first to find the fabled Northwest Passage; and the flawed hero John Franklin, a meek naval officer whose expeditions were responsible for the deaths of more men than those of any other Arctic explorer. Travel with the adventurer Roald Amundsen, the cool Norwegian who completed a voyage in a tiny sloop that the British Navy failed to accomplish with its great three-masted ships; Frederick Cook, who lied about reaching the North Pole; and finally, the ruthless and paranoid Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1909. As much about the explorers who braved impossible odds as it is about each expedition, Arctic Grail is an epic account of the Golden Age of Exploration at the top of the world.

For others, later, there was Greenwich Village, Big Sur, and Woodstock. But for an even later generation&#x2014;one defined by the likes of Jimmy Buffett, Tom McGuane, and Hunter S. Thompson&#x2014;there was another moveable feast: KeyWest, Florida.<br><br>The small town on the two-by-four-mile island has long been an artistic haven, a wild refuge for people of all persuasions, and the inspirational home for a league of great American writers. Some of the artists went there to be literary he-men. Some went to re-create themselves. Others just went to disappear&#x2014;and succeeded. No matter what inspired the trip, Key West in the seventies was the right place at the right time, where and when an astonishing collection of artists wove a web of creative inspiration.<br><br><i>Mile Marker Zero </i>tells the story of how these writers and artists found their identities in Key West and maintained their friendships over the decades, despite oceans of booze and boatloads of pot, through serial marriages and sexual escapades, in that dangerous paradise.<br><br>Unlike the &#x201c;Lost Generation&#x201d; of Paris in the twenties, we have a generation that invented, reinvented, and found itself at the unending cocktail party at the end&#x2014;and the beginning&#x2014;of America&#x2019;s highway.</p><p>WILLIAM McKEEN teaches at Boston University, where he chairs the department of journalism. He is the author or editor of nine books, including the acclaimed Hunter S. Thompson biography <i>Outlaw Journalist</i>. He is married and the father of seven children and lives on the rocky coast of Cohasset, Massachusetts.<br>&nbsp;<br>williammckeen.com&#x201c;A tall but telescopic-sight-true tale of Hunter Thompson, Jimmy Buffet, Tom McGuane, and a large cavorting cast running around with sand in their shoes at &#x2018;ground zero for lust and greed and most of the other deadly sins:&#x2019; Key West.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tom Wolfe<br><br>"<i>Mile Marker Zero</i> is a wonderful zinger of a book. Never before have the literary traditions of the Conch Republic been mined for such gold nugget anecdotes. McKeen has once again proven why he is perhaps the most lucid and imaginative professor of journalism history in modern-day America. Every page sings a story worth a&nbsp;<br>Jimmy Buffett song." &#x2014;Douglas Brinkley<br><br>"Not just another paean to sex, drugs, and rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll, William McKeen's gritty, no-holds-barred oeuvre, <i>Mile Marker Zero</i>, carefully and thoroughly establishes the groundwork for understanding and appreciating the achievement of literary mavericks and artists of Key West in the Seventies. This treatment of the personal lives and works of Tom McGuane, Jim Harrison, Russell Chatham, Jimmy Buffet, Hunter S. Thompson...offers an arresting and instructive rendering of this colorful cadre of characters, in the shadow of Key West's most famous resident, Ernest Hemingway, drawn together in this tropical Greenwich Village to establish a new enclave on the fringe." &#x2014;Beef Torrey, Co-Editor of <i>Jim Harrison:&nbsp; A Comprehensive Bibliography</i>, <i>Conversations with Hunter S. Thompson</i>, and <i>Conversations with Thomas McGuane</i><br><br>"An engrossing tell-all in which Key West's most notable residents struggle to find sanity, sobriety and a place to call home."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews<br><br></i>&#x201c;McKeen's portrait of Key West as a onetime bohemian utopia and hotspot is atmospheric, and...his anecdotes are absorbing.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly<br><br></i>&#x201c;A romp....a rollicking chronicle of the musicians, artists, writers and filmmakers who created a vibrant if nihilistic scene in the 1970s. Deft storytelling...a good story about good times (and bad)&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal<br><br></i>&#x201c;Make McKeen's tale your next trip to the island.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;Sun Sentinel<br></i><br>"You may not believe that these writers were able to take their eyes off the famous Key West sunset to focus on their work, but every feast needs a backdrop."<i>&#x2014;Cape Cod Times <br><br></i>&#x201c;[E]nthralling...Mr. McKeen is perfectly placed to relay the antics of this decadent decade, not merely because of his academic credentials, but more importantly because of his fine use of the English language. His words would most certainly draw a nod of approval from all those he writes about and clearly admires...Well-crafted observations....are indicative of just how in tune with the era the author is. <br>&nbsp;<br>There is a saying that if you remember the sixties, then you weren&#x2019;t there; in the same vein, this book should be read by not only anyone with even a passing interest in this fascinating period of literary creativity, but also by anyone who actually was in Key West during the seventies&#x2014;they could probably use a few reminders of just what was buzzing on the island at the time anyway."<i>&#x2014;New York Journal of Books<br><br></i>&#x201c;[O]nly enhances the appeal of the Conch Republic....a tale of the island's famous personalities that flows as easily as an ocean breeze."<i>&#x2014;Orlando Sentinel&nbsp;</i><br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i></p><h2>Brother Wolf: A Forgotten Promise</h2><p>The work of dedicated, wolf-obsessed wildlife photographer Brandenburg is splendidly displayed in this beautifully designed and produced book. The photos, which could really stand alone, are accompanied by less interesting text in which Brandenburg describes his experiences in search of wolves and his mental meandering on the subject.

The story of a farm boy from Georgia and his colourful climb in the NFL. We tend to think of coaches as martinets with whistles around their necks. Reeves shows us a different side, one filled with warmth, humour, and sometimes, great compassion. Like the man, this book is direct, unpretentious, and a winner.</p><p>Reeves, former player and coach for the Dallas Cowboys, now coaches the Denver Broncos, so this book should find an audience in Texas and Colorado. Aided by sports columnist Connor of the Rocky Mountain News , he covers his days as a college and pro player, including the knee injury that cut short his playing career. This material is less interesting and revealing than the chapters on coaching, with insights into how a coaching staff works, interplay of personalities and, most significantly, the tone that is set by the head coach. Reeves was involved with losing Super Bowl teams in Dallas, but in the past two seasons he suffered serious defeat when the Broncos dropped two championship games, a subject on which he is candid and forthright here.

An UNSUB&#x2014;what the FBI calls an unknown subject&#x2014;the Prophet terrorized the Bay Area in the 1990s and nearly destroyed her father, the lead investigator on the case.<br><br> The Prophet&#x2019;s cryptic messages and mind games drove Detective Mack Hendrix to the brink of madness, and&nbsp;Mack&#x2019;s failure to solve the series of ritualized murders&#x2014;eleven seemingly unconnected victims left with the ancient sign for Mercury etched into their flesh&#x2014;was the final nail in the coffin for a once promising career.<br><br> Twenty years later, two bodies are found bearing the haunting signature of the Prophet. Caitlin Hendrix has never escaped the shadow of her father&#x2019;s failure to protect their city. But now the ruthless madman is killing again and has set his sights on her, threatening to undermine the fragile barrier&nbsp;she rigidly maintains for her own protection,&nbsp;between relentless pursuit and dangerous obsession.<br><br> Determined to decipher his twisted messages and stop the carnage, Caitlin ignores her father&#x2019;s warnings as she draws closer to the killer with each new gruesome murder. Is it a copycat, or can this really be the same Prophet who haunted her childhood? Will Caitlin avoid repeating her father&#x2019;s mistakes and redeem her family name, or will chasing the Prophet drag her and everyone she loves into the depths of the abyss?</p><p><b>Meg Gardiner&nbsp;</b>is the author of twelve critically acclaimed novels, including&nbsp;<i>China Lake</i>, which won the Edgar Award. Originally from Santa Barbara, California, she lives in Austin, Texas.1<br><br> Equinox<br><br> Present Day<br><br> Weapon at her side, eyes on the night, Caitlin approached the house. Fog clung to the ground, rolling thick off San Francisco Bay. It hid the stars, their faces, the view beyond.<br><br> Silently they climbed the steps to the broad porch. The March chill weeviled down Caitlin's arms. By the doorbell a faded sticker announced that jesus saves, but Caitlin saw no evidence of it. Not tonight, she thought. Tonight, he didn't get the call.<br><br> They stacked up beside the door. Behind drawn blinds, a television burbled. Intel suggested that six people were inside. But suggested didn't mean confirmed.<br><br> Caitlin's heart beat hard against her ballistic vest. Beneath it she wore a T-shirt, jeans, and work boots. Her auburn hair was tucked beneath a ball cap. Her nerves were tuned to an ultrahigh frequency, adrenaline crackling through her like static, waiting for the sign.<br><br> The raid leader held up a fist. The team stilled.<br><br> Rios was an Oakland Police Department sergeant, built like a furnace in black tactical gear. He glanced at them over his shoulder: Oakland Police, San Francisco PD, Alameda County. Caitlin's vest said sheriff. Her ball cap said narcotics task force. They gave him a thumbs-up.<br><br> The moments before, the suspense, always fried her. Anticipation was hell. The hateful uncertainty. The house was two-story, decrepit, secretly humming with danger. Caitlin hugged the stucco wall, SIG Sauer warm in her hand. At her back, a young Alameda sheriff's deputy named Marston thrummed with apprehension. Come on, she thought. Jesus might not get the call tonight, but we're here. Let's move.<br><br> Rios raised his semiautomatic rifle and pounded on the door. "Police."<br><br> A dog barked. The TV droned. Rios drew back his arm to pound on the door again.<br><br> A gunshot from inside blew splinters across the porch.<br><br> The static in Caitlin's nerves resolved to a clear tone. Here we go.<br><br> Inside the house, feet pounded. Men yelled. Rios tested the doorknob. Locked. He signaled the fourth man in the stack, an Oakland cop who held the Little Pig.<br><br> Caitlin braced for more gunfire. The Oakland cop, Hillyer, rounded them and aimed the Little Pig at the dead bolt. The scaled-down shotgun was loaded with a breaching round. He fired from an inch away. The dead bolt assembly blew into the house and Hillyer stepped aside. The door yawned open. The Master Key-it worked on any lock.<br><br> Rios said, "Go, go." Rifle to his shoulder, he led the formation in.<br><br> The lights were dim, the floor warped. Tight and fluid, they swept into the hall. Rios aimed ahead, then to the right.<br><br> "Right clear," he said.<br><br> Caitlin stepped to the left, pistol level. Checked her sector. "Left clear."<br><br> The hall reeked of sulfur and ammonia. At the back of the house, a battering ram smashed open the rear door.<br><br> Marston stepped past her, checked his sector. "Clear."<br><br> They closed up behind Rios, left hands on the shoulder of the person in front of them, and advanced to the wide doorway to the living room. Rios pointed. Go. He swung in.<br><br> "Drop it," he yelled.<br><br> A gun clattered to the floor.<br><br> Caitlin came in behind him. Again she checked her sector. Rios yelled, "Get down," and peripherally she saw a man drop to his knees. She said, "Left clear." Rios kicked a handgun away from the suspect and held his rifle on him while Marston and Hillyer swept the room.<br><br> "All clear."<br><br> Down the hall, men shouted. Footsteps raced back and forth.<br><br> Rios pointed at Caitlin and Marston and put two fingers to his eyes. "Kitchen. Go."<br><br> Caitlin returned to the hall. At the far end, men grabbed stacks of cash and fled with officers in pursuit. She advanced toward the kitchen door, weapon level, finger on the trigger. Her pulse pounded in her ears. The kid, Marston, closed up behind her.<br><br> His breath warmed her neck. She was taller than he was, five-ten, and, for the moment, a shield. In another room, someone shouted and slammed into a wall.<br><br> "Clear," an officer shouted.<br><br> The stench of ammonia burned her throat. At the threshold she stopped, concealed. Heard nothing from the kitchen. Marston's hand grabbed her shoulder. She nodded: Ready to clear the room. He squeezed: I'll be right behind you. They moved together.<br><br> She swung through the door with Marston on her heels, peripherally checking the gap between the door and the frame. Vision pulsing, SIG sweeping the room. She immediately stepped out of the doorway. The fatal funnel, path of most bullets.<br><br> "Right clear," she said.<br><br> Marston went around her. "Left clear."<br><br> Crusted dishes covered the counter. On the table sat a money scale, colorful currency straps, and a pile of cash. A trail of twenty-dollar bills wafted across the linoleum in the clammy breeze blowing through the window. The screen had been punched out. It looked like a quick getaway.<br><br> A shiver climbed Caitlin's arms. She hated having a doorway behind her. Even though the team had cleared the hall, a door always felt like a hungry mouth at her back.<br><br> And the window opened to darkness. To anyone outside, she and Marston were brightly lit targets.<br><br> Marston's knuckles were white on his gun. He was waiting for the all clear.<br><br> Beneath the chemical stench hung the reek of sweat. She eyed the darkness outside, a pantry in the corner of the room, and the twenties on the floor. The money didn't actually lead in a trail to the window.<br><br> Marston stepped toward the table. Outside, the dog barked again.<br><br> Caitlin raised her left hand, fisted. "Stop . . ."<br><br> The pantry door flew open. A man lunged out.<br><br> Shirtless, strung out, he charged toward the table. A butcher knife gleamed in his right hand. Caitlin turned to put him in her sights.<br><br> Marston was directly beyond him in her line of fire.<br><br> Screeching, the man drove the knife forward.<br><br> She launched at him, a flying dive, and tackled him around the chest. He was ripe with sour sweat. Twenties were falling from his pockets. They hit the kitchen table and slid across it. Twitching eyes. Blackened teeth. Clawing hands. She worked the momentum and rolled, flinging him with her to the floor. He shrieked like a smoke alarm.<br><br> She flipped him facedown and subdued him with a wristlock, forcing his head into the linoleum, knee shoved against his elbow. Marston stood above her, eyes on his own chest. The knife jutted from his ballistic vest.<br><br> Rios came through the door, weapon raised. He stopped at the sight of Marston and of the man thrashing under Caitlin's grip amid broken dishes and crumpled cash.<br><br> Marston pulled the knife from his vest. "All clear."<br><br> Rios lowered his rifle. "The guy pop out of the toaster?"<br><br> Caitlin handcuffed the man and pulled him to his feet. "It's the meth fairy. Tweakerbell."<br><br> Rios's eyes didn't match his light tone.<br><br> "Under control," she said.<br><br> Marston touched his vest, wincing like his ribs were bruised. Rios told him to bag the knife for evidence and take the suspect into custody. As Marston led him away, Hillyer appeared in the doorway.<br><br> "House is clear," he said.<br><br> Caitlin followed Rios into the hall. The yelling and running had stopped. In the living room three men sat cuffed on the floor, backs against the wall. The SFPD officers were counting bags of crystal meth. She holstered her gun and exhaled.<br><br> Overhead came a noise. They all tilted their heads to the ceiling.<br><br> Rios pointed at Caitlin and Hillyer. "Upstairs. Two bedrooms. Go."<br><br> The tone in her head revved like a firehouse Klaxon. She didn't ask what the team had missed. She drew her gun again and led Hillyer down the dingy hallway. Her vest felt heavy. So did the SIG Sauer, in a two-handed combat grip. At the foot of the stairs, Hillyer put his hand on her shoulder. Steady. Together they climbed.<br><br> Upstairs they cleared the hall and first bedroom. The second bedroom door was half closed. From within came muffled sounds. Caitlin leveled the SIG. Not gonna get surprised again. Gonna be ready.<br><br> The sounds intensified. Almost a cry. She and Hillyer stopped outside the door. They had concealment but not cover, not if whoever was inside decided to shoot them through the plywood. She tried to slow her breathing. She nodded, Hillyer squeezed her shoulder, and she flowed through the door, gun aimed at the source of the sound.<br><br> "Sheriff. Don't move."<br><br> The crying intensified. Hillyer slid around her, his weapon swinging.<br><br> "Stop. Stop." She raised a fist. Grabbed Hillyer's vest. "Don't move. Don't breathe. Take your finger off the trigger." She lowered her gun. "Oh, my God."<br><br> 2<br><br> Caitlin closed the front door behind her and flipped the dead bolt. Her footsteps echoed on the hardwood floor. A table lamp gave the living room an amber glow. She reached to unhook her duty belt. She couldn't get her fingers to work the buckle. She closed her eyes and clenched her fists. After a few seconds the shaking eased. She unbuckled the belt and dropped it, clattering, on the coffee table.<br><br> Her jeans were torn, her knee swollen where she'd hit the crank-house kitchen floor. Her red hair was disheveled. Beneath her white T-shirt, the scarred bullet hole in her shoulder ached. The world seemed bright and supersonic.<br><br> From the back of the house, Shadow came running. Big ears alert, tongue lolling. Caitlin knelt and buried her face in Shadow's soft exuberance and let the dog lick her face. The tremor in her hands subsided.<br><br> She leaned back and looked at Shadow's bright eyes. "Who's a good girl?"<br><br> The mutt yipped and sat, tail wagging. She was skinny, black with white paws. Caitlin roughed her fur, then groaned to her feet.<br><br> She followed Shadow to the kitchen and filled her water bowl. The small house was warm against the foggy night. It was a rental in Rockridge, a Craftsman cottage behind a Father Knows Best picket fence. The Berkeley Hills rose behind it. The neighborhood was crowded, eclectic, heavy with fir trees and spilling ivy-which meant she was safely beyond the fire line. At least until the fire line burned its way downhill to her street.<br><br> In her bedroom she cleared her SIG and set it on the dresser. She shucked off her clothes and showered away the eau de meth head and the knots in her shoulders. She was pulling on clean jeans and a T-shirt when she heard a knock on the front door and a key turning in the lock.<br><br> She leaned around the doorway and saw Sean Rawlins walking down the hall toward her. She exhaled.<br><br> Sean had just come off surveillance, but he didn't take his eyes off of her. His stride was long and slow, boots clocking on the floor. His dark hair was windblown. His brown eyes were intense. His great-great-grandfather had ridden with the Chiricahua Apache into the Sierra Madre, and Caitlin thought of that look as Sean's raider stare. The take-no-shit look he gave to suspects and car salesmen. She thought he was the best-looking thing she'd ever seen.<br><br> The stare turned to a smile. He held up a bottle of tequila.<br><br> She laughed, took the bottle, and tossed back a swallow. Her chest heated. She blew out a breath.<br><br> "Perfect."<br><br> She didn't drink during the week-holidays, Warriors' championships, and shots fired excepted.<br><br> "There's more," he said.<br><br> "Better be."<br><br> He pulled her along the hall to the kitchen. On the counter sat a brown paper bag from a neighborhood taqueria.<br><br> "Praise Jesus," Caitlin said.<br><br> They didn't bother with plates but stood at the kitchen island bent over their tacos, spilling pico de gallo.<br><br> "There's something else," he said.<br><br> "Did I win the lotto?"<br><br> "You made the news."<br><br> His voice, usually cool, took on an edge. He pulled up a video on his phone.<br><br> "Last thing I expected to see you carrying out of a crank house was a baby," he said.<br><br> "You never know what's behind door number three."<br><br> The screen went bright, the late news, and yeah, there she was.<br><br> Maybe the Narcotics Task Force had alerted the media about the raid. Maybe reports of gunfire had brought them out. She forgot the food and watched herself at a weird remove.<br><br> Coming out the front door of the crank house, cradling a squalling infant. On-screen, she blinked as though caught by surprise. She had been.<br><br> When she'd rounded the doorway into the upstairs bedroom at the raid house, she had been that close to firing. She could still feel the pressure of her finger on the trigger as she shouted at the room-and stopped dead.<br><br> Seeing the baby, only a few months old, trying to kick her way out from under the ratty blanket heaped on the floor. Window wide, cold air heaving in. Little fists clenched by her red face, chubby legs bicycling. Caitlin had holstered her gun and scooped her up. Stunned.<br><br> Just like she looked on the video. Under control, she'd told Rios. Like hell.<br><br> "For a little thing, she had a ton of fight in her. I hope that's a good sign," she said.<br><br> "Always," Sean said.

The remnants of her stress evaporated. She kissed him. Then wrapped her arms around his shoulders and kissed him some more.

Long before jets (and jet lag), these floating superlatives thundered on bruising schedule across the world&#39;s most dangerous ocean. The Only Way to Cross transports readers to that bygone maritime era, when dozens of liners steamed in and out of New York, accommodating the rich on lavish upper decks and hordes of immigrants deep within their holds. For those in first class, comfort, luxury, and privilege were endemic. Armchair travelers will relish anecdotes about the famous and infamous, the rich and eccentric. Royalty, financial barons, con artists, crooked gamblers, and stowaways rub shoulders within these evocative pages. But all is not rarified glitz. Beneath paneled veneer lies reassuring steel. Maxtone-Graham documents not only the vessels&#39; engineering and architectural marvels, but also the perilous storms and fogs as well as the lives of the liners&#39; permanent inhabitants; we encounter stewards, sailors, stokers, and the gruff, austere warmth of their masters on the bridge. The pages are immeasurable enriched by 200 archival photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Rick Steves France 2017</h2><p>You can count on Rick Steves to tell you what you <i>really</i> need to know when traveling in France.<br><br>With this guide, you&#x2019;ll explore sleepy villages, romantic hill towns, and cosmopolitan cities, including Paris, Avignon, and Nice.

Just the thought caused nausea to well up at the back of her throat. How could this have happened? Danny was the best poker player in Overlin, Texas. He'd been playing for extra money ever since the older men started letting him sit in on friendly games.</p> <p>"No one would let you play for stakes that high," Carla said to her brother. "They know what I'd do to them if they did." Carla liked a good time as much as anyone, but she never mixed business with pleasure, and anything having to do with the ranch or money was business.</p> <p>"He was a stranger. Some guy named Laveau diViere."</p> <p>"Did Ed know him? Frank? Lukey? Anybody?"</p> <p>Danny shook his head.</p> <p>"Then why did you play with him?"</p> <p>"Nobody else wanted to play."</p> <p>"How could you be stupid enough to play for that much money?"</p> <p>"I didn't mean to, but I let him goad me into taking a drink."</p> <p>"Why? You know you can't drink."</p> <p>"He kept saying I didn't drink because I was too young, that my mama wouldn't let me, that I wasn't man enough to hold my liquor. I know that was dumb, but he was so cocksure, I wanted to take him down a notch. I was doing okay until I bet too much on a good hand."</p> <p>"Why didn't you stop there?"</p> <p>"Because he was such an arrogant son-of-a-bitch. I just wanted to wipe that awful smile off his face."</p> <p>"Enough to risk your half of the ranch?"</p> <p>"I had an unbeatable hand. A royal flush ace high."</p> <p>"Nothing's unbeatable except four aces with jacks wild." She didn't play poker, but she knew the rules. "Did you sign anything? Was it witnessed?"</p> <p>"He made me sign a paper before he would accept my bet. Lots of people saw me do it."</p> <p>So there was no mistake, no miraculous way out of this nightmare. She'd have to share the ranch her parents carved out of the wilderness with a man she'd never seen and already despised for taking advantage of a beardless boy.</p> <p>Over the following days she said a lot of things to Danny she regretted, or would come to regret once she was over the worst of the shock and outrage, but she wasn't there yet. Now it was more than a week later and still no sign of the villain who'd stolen half of their ranch. Each day that passed without his arrival wound Carla's nerves tighter. She awoke each morning dreading that it would be the day he would show up and went to bed each night relieved and anxious at the same time.</p> <p>Insignificant noises annoyed her. The sound of an approaching horse caused her breath to catch in her throat. The slightest aggravation sent her temper spiraling out of control. She paced from one room to another, taking note of things to do, yet leaving most of the tasks unfinished. She felt imprisoned in the house, but she couldn't leave it. Her concentration was gone. Thoughts flew out of her head as quickly as they entered. She was hungry, but the smell of food caused her stomach to heave. She hated to be by herself but couldn't stand to have anybody around. She was slowly going crazy, each of the previous nine days being a little worse than the one before. It had gotten so bad Danny had moved into the bunkhouse.</p> <p>Lukey, the only lawyer in Overlin, had told her Laveau diViere's claim was good, but she couldn't accept giving up any part of her ranch. Her father and mother had risked their lives to hold it against Indians, had worked themselves into early graves to make it successful. Danny loved the ranch as much as she did, so she couldn't understand how he could have risked it in a poker game.</p> <p>She left the kitchen and walked through the wide hall to the sitting room, but her mind took in nothing about the room her mother had labored to make into a space that reflected her gentile upbringing. Not the velvet-covered settee or the brocade curtains pulled back by heavy sashes. White sheers filtered the Texas sunlight that flooded the room with warmth at variance with the chill that arced down her spine every time she thought of having to yield part of her ranch to a stranger. Her stomach heaved so violently, she put her hand over her mouth, but she refused to be overcome by the thought of the man who'd destroyed her peace of mind. She was going to get her ranch back. To have a stranger running it would be an affront to the memory of her parents.</p> <p>Danny looked so much like their mother, Carla couldn't see him without thinking of what her mother would feel if she knew what happened. The ranch had been a job to their father, a way to make a living, but it had been life-changing to their mother. She had reveled in the freedom from the conventional restraints forced upon women in the little South Carolina town where she'd been born. She'd been excited when her husband suggested they try ranching in the new state of Texas. She had put up with hardship because she'd wanted Carla to grow up with freedoms she had never enjoyed. She had insisted that her husband buy their land. She didn't trust a system that allowed a rancher to claim land he didn't own. She hadn't understood ranching, but she'd liked it because it was different. She didn't understand Texans, either, but she loved them because they let her be herself no matter how unconventional or illogical.</p> <p>Yet inside the house, her mother had preserved part of her former way of life. Never having lived in South Carolina, that was a side of her mother Carla never understood, yet she loved the house because her mother had loved it.</p> <p>Carla straightened a doily, one of many her mother had crocheted during winter evenings. She ran her finger over the surface of a side table, but it left no trace. She already dusted it twice that day. She grunted in frustration. She couldn't stick with any task or keep her mind on any job as long as she was expecting this interloper any minute. Why didn't he come? Why did he have to come? Unable to stay cooped up in the house any longer she walked to the hall, opened the front door, and stepped out onto the porch.</p> <p>The air was hot and still, but the sun was sinking on the horizon. It would soon be time to start supper. Her brother had to eat, whether or not she felt like cooking. Irritated at her inability to be still, she sat down in a chair, determined to remain there until it was time to go to the kitchen. But she barely settled her skirts around her when she noticed a horseman in the distance.</p> <p>Her body went rigid, and her breath hitched. She shaded her eyes and squinted to see what detail she could make out. Was it someone she knew? Or was it him?</p> <p>Her first impression was that he was bigger than her brother, who was easily over six feet tall. He rode easily in the saddle, his posture so erect you'd have thought he was in a military parade. His horse, a sorrel with dark mane and tail, was several inches taller than any horse on her ranch, but the most distinctive thing about him was his dress. Despite the heat and the dust, he wore a coat over a vest, white shirt, and tie. His flat-topped, wide-brimmed hat didn't disguise his fair skin or cover his almost-white, blond hair. His black pants clung to his muscled thighs, and his boots practically glistened. Sunlight glinted off the polished surface of his silver-studded saddle and bridle. For a moment she thought he might be trying to imitate a Spanish caballero, but as he drew closer, she sensed that his manner of dress was a reflection of something inside him rather than the other way around. He had an almost regal presence about him which put her back up.</p> <p>He probably thought he was better than she was, better than anybody in Overlin, most likely better than anybody in Texas. He rode like he owned the world.</p> <p>She told herself to relax. Danny had said Laveau diViere was dark and a native Texan of Spanish descent. It was unlikely he would have any connection to this blond giant. This man was probably lost. He certainly didn't know how to dress for Texas.</p> <p>Yet as he drew closer, she found herself subjected to different feelings. He was so handsome no woman could look upon him and not be affected. There was a cool perfection about him that implied all feeling-mental, emotional, or physical-would be kept under tight control. She shivered despite the heat.</p> <p>She got an unexpected surprise when he drew close enough to smile at her. All traces of disdain or cold cordiality fled, leaving her the recipient of a smile of incredible sweetness. Despite her usual reticence around strangers, it coaxed her to her feet and toward the steps. As he drew closer, she could see he was even more handsome than she first thought. What could such a man be doing wandering around Texas? He brought his horse to a stop, dismounted, and approached the bottom of the steps. He removed his hat and nodded in greeting.</p> <p>"Good afternoon, miss. I am looking for Danny Reece." He spoke with an accent she couldn't quite place.</p> <p>"I'm Carla Reece. Danny is my brother, but he's not here right now. Can I help you?"</p> <p>"I am Ivan Nikolai. I have come to take over Laveau diViere's half of your ranch."</p></p><h2>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (A New Verse Translation)</h2><p>The classical medieval poem relating Sir Gawain&#39;s romances, his conflict with the Green Knight, and return to the Round Table</p><p>Marie Borroff is Sterling Professor of English, Emeritus, at Yale University.

ROZAN is author of many critically acclaimed novels which have won most of crime fiction's greatest honors, including the Edgar, Shamus, Anthony, Macavity, and Nero&nbsp;awards.&nbsp; Born and raised in the Bronx, Rozan now lives in lower Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In a relentlessly chic and tranquil tea shop on the Lower East Side, I sat sipping gunpowder green and trying to figure out what my new client was up to. That the client, Jeff Dunbar, sat across the table laying out the case he was hiring me for, helped not at all.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about art,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d begun, stirring sugar into his straight-ahead American coffee after the pleased-to-meet-yous were over.<br>&#x201c;Art?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d tried to sound intrigued, as opposed to baffled, by this revelation. Dunbar had called the day before, saying he needed an investigator and had seen my Web site. I&#x2019;d expected, when we met on this chilly, bright spring morning, to hear a problem that was personal&#x2014;cheating fianc�e, two-timing wife&#x2014;or professional&#x2014;industrial espionage, embezzling employees. Straying spouses and shady secretaries are my daily bread and the Web site says so. It doesn&#x2019;t mention art, a specialty outside any of my areas of expertise. If this case was about art, I had to wonder, why call me?<br>Dunbar sent a dollop of milk to join the sugar. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a collector. Contemporary Chinese art. Do you know much about that?&#x201d;<br>Oh. This had to do with my contemporary Chineseness? &#x201c;Not much, no.&#x201d;<br>He nodded and settled back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a cutting-edge collecting area. Not really inside the PRC, even among the new rich, but in the West. Chinese painters, especially, but also sculptors, photographers, installation artists&#x2014;they&#x2019;re all hot.&#x201d; His voice was pleasant, measured, as though lecturing at a symposium on the globalized cultural marketplace. He looked the part, too: thirtyish, short dark hair, polished shoes, the only business suit in sight. That his art and his prospective detective were both Chinese couldn&#x2019;t be coincidence, but the detective&#x2019;s ignorance seemed okay with him. My antennae went up. There&#x2019;s a class of Westerners who &#x201c;like rice&#x201d;: They&#x2019;re attracted to Asians, or, really, to their own exotic fantasies. If Jeff Dunbar had chosen Chinese art, and me, for that reason, he was about to get a fast good-bye. And stuck with the check.<br>But he didn&#x2019;t look it, and he wasn&#x2019;t acting it. Those guys invariably wear something Asian, at least a tie with a double-happiness pattern. They order tea. And, during Zen-like pauses, they gaze soulfully into my slanty eyes. Jeff Dunbar came across as a guy in a boring suit conducting a business meeting.<br>I decided to see where this was going. &#x201c;Tell me about this art. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve seen much of it.&#x201d; I ransacked my brain, came up with little besides misty mountains and pine trees from five or six dynasties back. &#x201c;Is it like classical art? Ink on paper, that kind of thing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Interesting you should ask that. Mostly, no. A lot of artists now work in Western media&#x2014;oils, acrylics. But the paintings I&#x2019;m concerned with happen to be inks.&#x201d; He set his cup down. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a painter named Chau Chun. Referred to as Chau &#x2018;Gwai Ying Shung&#x2019;&#x2014;Ghost Hero Chau. Have you heard of him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, no.&#x201d; I added, &#x201c;Your pronunciation is very good. Do you speak Chinese?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks. Yes, I minored in it in college. It occurred to me that people who spoke the language would be increasingly in demand.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you majored in?...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Art, of course.&#x201d;<br>Of course, except for the half-second pause before he said it. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to interrupt. You were telling me about Ghost Hero Chau.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Well, Chau was a young professor at the Beijing Art Institute in the 1980s. His work from that period is very valuable.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How valuable is &#x2018;very&#x2019;? &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A piece will sell for around half a million. A little more, a little less, depending.&#x201d;<br>Yes, I thought, that would be &#x201c;very.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A lot of artists his age were doing experimental work in those days,&#x201d; Dunbar went on, &#x201c;but Chau always worked in traditional media with traditional techniques. He made brush-and-ink scrolls: mountains, plum blossoms, lotus ponds. Classical-looking, and also traditional in another sense: They were political, but in arcane ways. Hidden symbols and metaphors, that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s traditional? I didn&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nature painting with coded commentary goes back to the Yuan Dynasty. About eight hundred years,&#x201d; he added, in case I didn&#x2019;t know my dynasties. &#x201c;The commentary&#x2019;s aimed at educated people of the painter&#x2019;s political persuasion, but the coding gives the painter deniability. But don&#x2019;t worry, Ms. Chin. I didn&#x2019;t expect you to have any expertise in this field. That&#x2019;s not why I called.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have to admit that&#x2019;s a relief. So tell me, what can I do for you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Recently, some new paintings of Ghost Hero Chau&#x2019;s seem to have surfaced. Again, inks, and again, political, criticizing the government, the Party, the economic free-for-all going on in China and the social disasters it&#x2019;s causing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised that&#x2019;s allowed. Criticizing the government can get you in trouble over there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very much so, if you&#x2019;re an activist lawyer, say. Or a writer. Artists, less often.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What makes them special?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, it could be liberalization. Those hundred flowers finally blooming. Or,&#x201d; he smiled, &#x201c;maybe it&#x2019;s that the artists are cash cows. The West loves political work. Collectors pay a fortune and the government takes a cut.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It does?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, so does ours, from our artists. We call it taxes. They call it something else but the result&#x2019;s the same. Also, there&#x2019;s national pride. Sky-high prices make China a player in the art world.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But if the paintings are critical?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, but with visual works, you can always say seeing something as antigovernment misses the point. That it was meant as ironic, tongue-in-cheek.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Deniability, like in the Yuan Dynasty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s what the artists say? To keep the government off their backs?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what the government says, to explain why someone&#x2019;s allowed to say in paint what a writer gets years of hard labor for saying in words. Of course, writers&#x2019; manifestos aren&#x2019;t going for half a million U.S. dollars. The artists who get in trouble are the ones who don&#x2019;t keep their mouths shut. The ones who let their work do the talking are pretty safe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I see. So people like this Ghost Hero Chau are insulated by money. I guess I&#x2019;m not surprised.&#x201d;<br>But Dunbar shook his head. &#x201c;Chau&#x2019;s a special case. For one thing, if what I hear is true, the new paintings are here, in New York.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If what you hear is true? You mean you haven&#x2019;t seen them?&#x201d; I was getting a glimmer of what this was about.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I haven&#x2019;t, and no one seems to know where they are. I&#x2019;m hoping you can find them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m Chinese?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That sounds like racial profiling, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; He smiled again. &#x201c;I suppose it is. It occurred to me, if I wasn&#x2019;t having any luck tracking the paintings through art channels, there might be another way. I did an online search for a Chinese investigator.&#x201d;<br>I might have taken offense, but after all, that&#x2019;s why my Chinese clients come to me, too. &#x201c;Tell me something, Mr. Dunbar. If no one&#x2019;s seen these paintings, what makes you think they exist?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Rumors. The collecting community&#x2019;s always full of rumors. Backhanded, of course, because everyone&#x2019;s trying to beat everyone to the prize.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can you give me an example?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, someone sidles up to you at an opening and asks if you&#x2019;ve heard this nonsense about the new Chaus, the Ghost Hero&#x2019;s ghost paintings that don&#x2019;t exist. They&#x2019;re hoping you&#x2019;ll say, <i>Yes, they do, I saw them.</i> If you do, they&#x2019;ll ask where, as if you must be crazy, and when you tell them, they&#x2019;ll laugh and say you&#x2019;ve lost your touch, someone&#x2019;s passing off fakes and you fell for it. Ghost Hero Chau, for God&#x2019;s sake. Then it&#x2019;s, <i>Oh, look at the time, I&#x2019;ve got to go</i>, and before they&#x2019;re out the door they&#x2019;re speed-dialing whoever you said had the Chaus.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s been going on?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Variations of it. For about a week now. But I&#x2019;ve spoken to the galleries and private dealers&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sure everyone else has, too&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve gotten nowhere. Only one gallery assistant even admitted to knowing what I was talking about, and then he backpedaled. I think he realized he was in over his head. The Chinese contemporary world&#x2019;s pretty small and his boss must be as eager as anyone to find these paintings. If I end up with them because this kid put me on the inside track, and his boss finds out, he&#x2019;s up a creek. Plus, I just started collecting. He might be willing to go out on a limb for one of the big collectors, but he doesn&#x2019;t know me from a hole in the ground.&#x201d;<br>A creek, a limb, and a hole in the ground. Maybe these were nature metaphors with hidden political meaning.<br>&#x201c;So what do you think, Ms. Chin? Can you find them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Dunbar, you&#x2019;re not even sure these paintings exist. Why not wait until they either surface, or it all turns out to be smoke? I guess what I&#x2019;m asking is, Why is paying for an investigation worth it?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not that I wanted to talk myself out of work, but something wasn&#x2019;t adding up here.<br>Jeff Dunbar regarded me. &#x201c;Do you collect anything, Ms. Chin? Stamps, coins, Barbie dolls?&#x201d; He added, &#x201c;Guns?&#x201d; Racial profiling, but carefully politically correct about gender.<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>He leaned forward. &#x201c;For a collector, the hunt&#x2019;s as much of a thrill as the find. I want these Chaus, if they&#x2019;re real. But I also want to be the one who finds them, and finds out if they&#x2019;re real. Especially since I&#x2019;m the new kid on the block. Does that make sense?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guess so,&#x201d; I said, though the collector&#x2019;s passion, to me, is like gravity: I admit it has a pull but I don&#x2019;t understand it.<br>&#x201c;Also,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a time issue.&#x201d;<br>Ah. Time is money. And money does talk.<br>&#x201c;Asian Art Week starts Sunday. All over town: The auction houses, the museums and galleries, two big Armory shows, and a show the Chinese government&#x2019;s sending over called Beijing/NYC. Mostly classical art and antiquities, but a lot of contemporary, too. The big collectors, the critics, the curators all come. From everywhere&#x2014;Asia and Europe, as well as here. If these Chaus exist, whoever has them might be planning to unveil them then.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To make a splash.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you want them so you can make the splash.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I told you the collecting world&#x2019;s small? It&#x2019;s also closed and clannish. Some things I&#x2019;m interested in I never get a shot at, because when they show up, I&#x2019;m not the one who gets the call. I want that to change. If I had the new Chaus, trust me, that would change.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right. But there&#x2019;s something else. I don&#x2019;t know much about this, but wouldn&#x2019;t an artist, or a dealer or somebody, whoever has these paintings, either just put them on the market, or not? I mean, one or the other. Rumors, mystery, paintings no one&#x2019;s seen that may or not be real&#x2014;is this how the art world works?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Normally, no. But as I said, Ghost Hero Chau is a special case. The possibility of new paintings by him would be bound to stir up all kinds of mystery and rumors.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And why is that?&#x201d;<br>Dunbar sat back. &#x201c;Are you familiar with the uprising at Tiananmen Square in 1989?&#x201d;<br>I thought for a moment. &#x201c;A democracy movement that never got off the ground, crushed by the Party. That&#x2019;s about all I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Correct. They sent the army in against the protestors. Hundreds of people were killed. Including Ghost Hero Chau. Ms. Chin, he&#x2019;s been dead for twenty years.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by S. J.

She exhibits widely and runs courses at West Dean College. She has written for magazines including <i>The Quilter</i> and has contributed to <i>Workshop on the Web</i>. Cas lives in Maidstone, Kent.</p>It is not exactly a how-to but a wonderful European way of describing the art of the lost&#x2014;and found again. For British artist Holmes, being green is a by-product of her textile (and paper) art; almost any object, found anywhere, is cause for celebration&#x2014;and inspiration. This very contemporary re-use of materials takes a little getting used to. Plus, the author, determined to persuade novices to do it themselves, includes very few detailed instructions; rather, she simply lists combinations of surfaces and the use of different tools and methods without specific suggestions. The section on joining layers, for instance, features commercial wallpaper paste as well as later references to hand and machine stitching. To a crafter&#x2019;s delight, new terms and techniques are explored in some depth; momigami, the Japanese form of kneaded paper, contains streamlined instructions, as do sun printing, low-tech image transfer, and decoupage. Each page is colored with inspiring images, such as &#x201c;Candy Colours&#x201d; or plastic sherbet straws, just enough to whet any would-be artist&#x2019;s appetite.

Tims Creek looks to outsiders like a dull North Carolina backwater settled by the descendants of slaves and slaveholders, now farmers, shop owners, factory workers, and general layabouts. But locals, as Kenan makes clear in the telling, know that nearly every dwelling in this fertile country houses a fascinating, if rarely flattering, tale. The Pickett house harbors the legend of three-year-old Clarence, who foretold his neighbors' fate (whether or not they wanted to hear it) and communicated with the dead until they called him to join them at the age of five; the rundown Williams shack shelters young Dean Williams, who foolishly agreed to seduce the town's richest black man in exchange for the promise of a job as a factory foreman; in the Pearsall home, a middle-aged mother unravels to the point of infanticide; and on her own front porch, old Maggie MacGowan Williams tries to come to terms with the fact of her beloved grandson's homosexuality. In coloring in the background of a town founded by runaway slaves, sustained by hypocritical preachers and ambitious exiled intellectuals, and taken over by bloodless modern-day manipulators--a land in which the dead live side by side with the living and the good fraternize with evil as a matter of course--Kenan switches unpredictably from the seductive rhythms of traditional folk tales to a drier, more distanced narrative voice, and even, in the title story, to a playful takeoff of a scholarly oral history, complete with lengthy footnotes. A wildly uneven but always original portrait of a southern community--and a stimulating collection of tales by a courageous and humorous author. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But before the sands of time shift very far, all will be risking their lives foiling murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers, and ancient curses. And the Hippopotamus Pool?

The mysterious disappearance of that midnight visitor before he can disclose the secret! Thus begins Amelia&#39;s newest adventure along the Nile. Helped, or hampered, by two teenagers, their son, Ramses, and their beautiful ward, Nefret, the Emersons set sail for Thebes to find the hidden tomb of Queen Tetisheri. With them is a timid (or is she?) governess named Miss Marmaduke. Soon to join the expedition are Amelia&#39;s sister- and brother-in-law, Evelyn and Walter, whose marriage is going through a rocky patch. As usual, archaeology is only one of Amelia&#39;s concerns, as the Emersons encounter murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers and ancient Egyptian curses. The tomb, of course, will hold a stunning surprise. And the Hippopotamus Pool? It&#39;s an ancient Egyptian story of war and wits that Amelia is translating... and that alerts her to a hippo of a different stripe: a nefarious, overweight art dealer who may become her next archenemy.

She overcame an abused childhood, a bad marriage and extremely limited opportunities to become one of the most popular author/speakers in the world. Joyce Meyer Ministries was the first ministry in America to be headed by a woman, and it&#39;s one of the largest in the world. If anyone knows how to hold on to a dream and realize it, it&#39;s her. Packed with examples of people who pursued their goals relentlessly, the book profiles nearly fifty individuals who prevailed against all odds. From the builder of the Brooklyn Bridge to the chemists who invented Post-It notes we meet people like Bessie Coleman, an African-American who had to go to flight school in Paris in order to learn how to fly. But she did, becoming the first woman in America to earn her pilot&#39;s license in 1920.</p><p>Joyce Meyer is one of the world's leading practical Bible teachers. A #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, she has written more than seventy inspirational books, including <i>The Confident Woman; Look Great, Feel Great</i>, the entire Battlefield of the Mind family of books, and many others. She has also released thousands of audio teachings as well as a complete video library. Joyce's <i>Enjoying Everyday Life</i> radio and television programs are broadcast around the world, and she travels extensively conducting conferences. Joyce and her husband, Dave, are the parents of four grown children and make their home in St. Louis, Missouri.It&#39;s not surprising that Joyce Meyer has written a book about never giving up. Having gone through childhood sexual abuse, an abusive first marriage, and a battle with breast cancer, Meyer is the epitome of soldiering on. In this book she outlines a plan for personal success, based upon what she has learned in life. Combining stories of her life experiences, the struggles of others, and much scripture, she describes a positive lifestyle. Narrator Sandra McCollom does a credible job presenting this audiobook. Her clear, distinctive voice and ability to read with expression convey the Meyer&#39;s conviction. Further, her deliberate delivery gives the listener time to ponder Meyer&#39;s message.

Ruby's maddening habit becomes increasingly apparent as she happily endures a rainbow of wet paint in imitation of Angela's hand-painted outfit, proudly plagiarizes Angela's poetry and tries pink press-on nails after admiring Miss Hart's manicure. Finally, challenged to display a talent all her own, Ruby admits that she likes to hop and masterfully bounces around her desk. To her surprise, she impresses her classmates and wins Angela's friendship at last. Rathmann's expressively illustrated, quirky and individualistic first book encourages readers to have confidence and not to take skills, however unimpressive they may seem, for granted.

He told us everything was going to be alright. He was a best friend who whispered that he loved us to the exact extent his father loved him. He saw everything we did yet refused to condemn us ever. He was an incredibly powerful and supernatural God who could actually change the outcome of our horror into beauty.</p> <p>Then enter shame, time, failure, disappointment, and bad teaching. We learned to see him as disgusted that we haven t shaped up by now. We now have a hard time reading the words of Jesus without feeling he s telling us we re not enough and we should be better, after all he s done for us. And we pull back, not as easily daring to trust him with us, less willing to trust his plans, life and destiny for us.</p> <p>What if that voice didn t exist for us?</p> <p>What if we could read his voice, hear his voice, without an artificial, religious filter?</p> <p>And what if we discovered he has been caring about us, speaking to us, wooing us, entering into our daily events, from the very start, long before we took even a hint of interest in him?</p> <p>On My Worst Day allows us to watch one person s journey to re-discovering that voice of Jesus. We are allowed to imagine what Jesus might be saying to us in our best and worst, our horrid disasters and funniest moments. We will cry, laugh, and find ourselves in every story. And we will walk away changed; drenched with hope, and the best friend we found at the start.</p></p><p><br><br>As a great communicator and writer, John Lynch is a vital staff member of the Truefaced team and co-writer of bestsellers Bo s Cafe and The Cure. <br><br>Since 1997, John has been speaking nationally with the Truefaced team, of- ten acting out the popular Two Roads message and delivering compelling talks of living out of new identity.

The author lives in London.The Course of Love Infatuations<p></p> <br>The hotel is on a rocky outcrop, half an hour east of M�laga. It has been designed for families and inadvertently reveals, especially at mealtimes, the challenges of being part of one. Rabih Khan is fifteen and on holiday with his father and stepmother. The atmosphere among them is somber and the conversation halting. It has been three years since Rabih&#x2019;s mother died. A buffet is laid out every day on a terrace overlooking the pool. Occasionally his stepmother remarks on the paella or the wind, which has been blowing intensely from the south. She is originally from Gloucestershire and likes to garden.<br> <br>A marriage doesn&#x2019;t begin with a proposal, or even an initial meeting. It begins far earlier, when the idea of love is born, and more specifically the dream of a soul mate.<br> <br>Rabih first sees the girl by the water slide. She is about a year younger than him, with chestnut hair cut short like a boy&#x2019;s, olive skin, and slender limbs. She is wearing a striped sailor top, blue shorts, and a pair of lemon-yellow flip-flops. There&#x2019;s a thin leather band around her right wrist. She glances over at him, pulls what may be a halfhearted smile, and rearranges herself on her deck chair. For the next few hours she looks pensively out to sea, listening to her Walkman and, at intervals, biting her nails. Her parents are on either side of her, her mother paging through a copy of Elle and her father reading a Len Deighton novel in French. As Rabih will later find out from the guest book, she is from Clermont-Ferrand and is called Alice Saure.<br> <br>He has never felt anything remotely like this before. The sensation overwhelms him from the first. It isn&#x2019;t dependent on words, which they will never exchange. It is as if he has in some way always known her, as if she holds out an answer to his very existence and, especially, to a zone of confused pain inside him. Over the coming days, he observes her from a distance around the hotel: at breakfast in a white dress with a floral hem, fetching a yogurt and a peach from the buffet; at the tennis court, apologizing to the coach for her backhand with touching politeness in heavily accented English; and on an (apparently) solitary walk around the perimeter of the golf course, stopping to look at cacti and hibiscus.<br> <br>It may come very fast, this certainty that another human being is a soul mate. We needn&#x2019;t have spoken with them; we may not even know their name. Objective knowledge doesn&#x2019;t come into it. What matters instead is intuition, a spontaneous feeling that seems all the more accurate and worthy of respect because it bypasses the normal processes of reason.<br> <br>The infatuation crystallizes around a range of elements: a flip-flop hanging nonchalantly off a foot; a paperback of Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s Siddhartha lying on a towel next to the sun cream; well-defined eyebrows; a distracted manner when answering her parents and a way of resting her cheek in her palm while taking small mouthfuls of chocolate mousse at the evening buffet.<br> <br>Instinctively he teases out an entire personality from the details. Looking up at the revolving wooden blades of the ceiling fan in his room, in his mind Rabih writes the story of his life with her. She will be melancholy and street-smart. She will confide in him and laugh at the hypocrisy of others. She will sometimes be anxious about parties and around other girls at school, symptoms of a sensitive and profound personality. She&#x2019;ll have been lonely and will never until now have taken anyone else into her full confidence. They&#x2019;ll sit on her bed playfully enlacing their fingers. She, too, won&#x2019;t ever have imagined that such a bond could be possible between two people.<br> <br>Then one morning, without warning, she is gone and a Dutch couple with two small boys are sitting at her table. She and her parents left the hotel at dawn to catch the Air France flight home, the manager explains.<br> <br>The whole incident is negligible. They are never to meet again. He tells no one. She is wholly untouched by his ruminations. Yet, if the story begins here, it is because&#x2014;although so much about Rabih will alter and mature over the years&#x2014;his understanding of love will for decades retain precisely the structure it first assumed at the Hotel Casa Al Sur in the summer of his sixteenth year. He will continue to trust in the possibility of rapid, wholehearted understanding and empathy between two human beings and in the chance of a definitive end to loneliness.<br> <br>He will experience similarly bittersweet longings for other lost soul mates spotted on buses, in the aisles of grocery stores, and in the reading rooms of libraries. He will have precisely the same feeling at the age of twenty, during a semester of study in Manhattan, about a woman seated to his left on the northbound C train; and at twenty-five in the architectural office in Berlin where he is doing work experience; and at twenty-nine on a flight between Paris and London after a brief conversation over the English Channel with a woman named Chloe: the feeling of having happened upon a long-lost missing part of his own self.<br> <br>For the Romantic, it is only the briefest of steps from a glimpse of a stranger to the formulation of a majestic and substantial conclusion: that he or she may constitute a comprehensive answer to the unspoken questions of existence.<br> <br>The intensity may seem trivial&#x2014;humorous, even&#x2014;yet this reverence for instinct is not a minor planet within the cosmology of relationships. It is the underlying central sun around which contemporary ideals of love revolve.<br> <br>The Romantic faith must always have existed, but only in the past few centuries has it been judged anything more than an illness; only recently has the search for a soul mate been allowed to take on the status of something close to the purpose of life. An idealism previously directed at gods and spirits has been rerouted towards human subjects&#x2014;an ostensibly generous gesture nevertheless freighted with forbidding and brittle consequences, for it is no simple thing for any human being to honor over a lifetime the perfections he or she might have hinted at to an imaginative observer in the street, the office, or the adjoining airplane seat.<br> <br>It will take Rabih many years and frequent essays in love to reach a few different conclusions, to recognize that the very things he once considered romantic&#x2014;wordless intuitions, instantaneous longings, a trust in soul mates&#x2014;are what stand in the way of learning how to be with someone. He will surmise that love can endure only when one is unfaithful to its beguiling opening ambitions, and that, for his relationships to work, he will need to give up on the feelings that got him into them in the first place. He will need to learn that love is a skill rather than an enthusiasm.</p><h2>Voice Lessons: A Sisters Story</h2><p><p><i>Voice Lessons </i>is the story of one younger sister growing up in the shadow of a larger-than-life older sister&#x2015;looking up to her, wondering how they were alike and how they were different and, ultimately, learning how to live her own life and speak in her own voice on her own terms. </p><p>As Cara Mentzel, studied, explored, married, gave birth (twice) and eventually became an elementary school teacher, she watched her sister, Idina Menzel, from the wings and gives readers a front row seat to opening night of <i>Rent </i>and <i>Wicked</i>, a seat at the Tonys, and a place on the red carpet when her sister taught millions more, as the voice of Queen Elsa in the animated musical <i>Frozen, </i>to &#x201c;Let It Go.&#x201d; <i>Voice Lessons </i>is the story of sisters&#x2015;sisters with pig tails, sisters with boyfriends and broken hearts, sisters as mothers and aunts, sisters as teachers and ice-queens, sisters as allies and confidantes. </p><p>As Cara puts it, <i>&#x201c;</i>My big sister is Tony-Award-Winning, Gravity-Defying, Let-It-Go-Singing Idina Menzel who has received top billing on Broadway marquees, who has performed for Barbra Streisand and President Obama, at the Super Bowl and at the Academy Awards.

During the first years of the 20th century (Catton was born in 1899), Catton listened to the tales of old Civil War veterans and gained an interest in the War Between the States that would never leave him. But this book, unlike Catton&#39;s other works, isn&#39;t primarily about the Civil War. It&#39;s about growing up in a particular time and a place. Written with grace, warmth, and wit, it describes an era of trains and timber. People who know and love the forests of northern Michigan will appreciate this book immensely, as will anybody who has enjoyed Catton&#39;s other books and wants to learn a little bit more about the historian who is one of America&#39;s great storytellers.In this memoir, Catton remembers his youth, his family, his home town, and his coming of age.</p><h2>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</h2><p>Heroin&#39;s father is the greatest of all storytellers. His magical stories bring laughter to the sad city of Alifbay. But one day something goes wrong and his father runs out of stories to tell. Haroun is determined to return the storyteller&#39;s gift to his father. So he flies off on the back of the Hoopie bird to the Sea of Stories - and a fantastic adventure begins.</p><p>Immediately forget any preconceptions you may have about Salman Rushdie and the controversy that has swirled around his million-dollar head. You should instead know that he is one of the best contemporary writers of fables and parables, from any culture. <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i> is a delightful tale about a storyteller who loses his skill and a struggle against mysterious forces attempting to block the seas of inspiration from which all stories are derived. Here's a representative passage about the sources and power of inspiration: <blockquote> So Iff the water genie told Haroun about the Ocean of the Stream of Stories, and even though he was full of a sense of hopelessness and failure the magic of the Ocean began to have an effect on Haroun. He looked into the water and saw that it was made up of a thousand thousand thousand and one different currents, each one a different colour, weaving in and out of one another like a liquid tapestry of breathtaking complexity; and Iff explained that these were the Streams of Story, that each coloured strand represented and contained a single tale. Different parts of the Ocean contained different sorts of stories, and as all the stories that had ever been told and many that were still in the process of being invented could be found here, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was in fact the biggest library in the universe. And because the stories were held here in fluid form, they retained the ability to change, to become new versions of themselves, to join up with other stories and so become yet other stories; so that unlike a library of books, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was much more than a storeroom of yarns. It was not dead, but alive. <p> "And if you are very, very careful, or very, very highly skilled, you can dip a cup into the Ocean," Iff told Haroun, "like so," and here he produced a little golden cup from another of his waistcoat pockets, "and you can fill it with water from a single, pure Stream of Story, like so," as he did precisely that. </p></blockquote>Sir Salman Rushdie is the author of many novels including Grimus, Midnight&#39;s Children, Shame, The Satanic Verses, The Moor&#39;s Last Sigh, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Fury and Shalimar the Clown. He has also published works of non-fiction including The Jaguar Smile, Imaginary Homelands, The Wizard of Oz and, as co-editor, The Vintage Book of Short Stories.</p><h2>Treasury of Great Show Tunes: A Reader&#39;s Digest Songbook</h2><p>This outstanding hardcover collection features 91 all-time gems by this century&#39;s most famous musical composers.

Thomas says of her fellow sociopaths, we are your neighbors, co-workers, and quite possibly the people closest to you: lovers, family, friends. Our risk-seeking behavior and general fearlessness are thrilling, our glibness and charm alluring. Our often quick wit and outside-the-box thinking make us appear intelligent&#x2014;even brilliant. We climb the corporate ladder faster than the rest, and appear to have limitless self-confidence.&nbsp; Who are we? We are highly successful, non-criminal sociopaths and we comprise 4% of the American population (that&#x2019;s 1 in 25 people!). <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Confessions of a Sociopath</i> takes readers on a journey into the mind of a sociopath, revealing what makes the tick and what that means for the rest of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Written from the point of view of a diagnosed sociopath, it unveils these men and women who are &#x201c;hiding in plain sight&#x201d; for the very first time.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Confessions of a Sociopath</i> is part confessional memoir, part primer for the wary. Drawn from Thomas&#x2019; own experiences; her popular blog, Sociopathworld.com; and current and historical scientific literature, it reveals just how different &#x2013; and yet often very similar - sociopaths are from the rest of the world. The book confirms suspicions and debunks myths about sociopathy and is both the memoir of a high-functioning, law-abiding (well, mostly) sociopath and a roadmap &#x2013; right from the source - for dealing with the sociopath in your life, be it a boss, sibling, parent, spouse, child, neighbor, colleague or friend.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Thomas argues, while sociopaths aren't like everyone else, and it&#x2019;s true some of them are incredibly dangerous, they are not inherently evil. In fact, they&#x2019;re potentially more productive and useful to society than neurotypicals or &#x201c;empaths,&#x201d; as they fondly like to call &#x201c;normal&#x201d; people.&nbsp; <i>Confessions of a Sociopath</i> demystifyies sociopathic behavior and provide readers with greater insight on how to respond or react to protect themselves, live among sociopaths without becoming victims, and even beat sociopaths at their own game, through a bit of empathetic cunning and manipulation.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with M. E. Thomas</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Were you always aware that you were different?</strong></p> <p>A. Yes, though when I was young, I thought maybe it was just because I was smarter than everyone else. I saw things that other children did not see, was aware of the adult world in a way that even my smart siblings were not&#x2014;awkward interactions from the end of an affair, why my grandpa treated my dad differently from his other children (he was adopted), and so on. I knew other people did not see these things because I would reference them and get blank stares in return. I learned to keep things to myself, even to pretend I didn&#x2019;t see them. Those were probably some of my first attempts to wear a mask of normalcy.</p> <p><strong>Q. What are the common characteristics/behaviors shared by most sociopaths? Do they describe you, too?</strong></p> <p>A. Lack of remorse or concern for hurting or stealing; being deceitful, manipulative, impulsive, irritable, aggressive, and consistently irresponsible; failure to conform to social norms; and being unconcerned about people&#x2019;s safety, including their own. You need to have at least three of these to be a sociopath. I have them all, to varying degrees.</p> <p><strong>Q. You believe that sociopaths have a natural competitive advantage. Why?</strong></p> <p>A. Sociopaths have several skills that lend themselves to success in areas such as politics and business: charm, an ability to see and exploit weaknesses/flaws (which in politics is called &#x201c;power-broking&#x201d; and in business, &#x201c;arbitrage&#x201d;), confidence, unflagging optimism, an ability to think outside the box and come up with original ideas, and a lack of squeamishness about doing what it takes to get ahead.</p> <p><strong>Q. If you don&#x2019;t have a sense of morality, or feel the emotions that most people do, how are you able to operate in the world without being detected?</strong></p> <p>A. I think everyone learns to lie about his or her emotions to a certain extent; I just take it a step farther. People ask, &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; and you respond, &#x201c;fine,&#x201d; even though you had a fight with your spouse that morning, have a sick child, or any multitude of things that make it hard for you to feel fine about almost anything in your life. You could honestly answer the question, but you don&#x2019;t because overt displays of strong emotion in ordinary social interactions are not accepted. Most of the time I don&#x2019;t need to show any emotion at all, and I try to limit the times that I do by begging off attending funerals, weddings, etc. When I do show up to these functions, I try to mimic the other attendees. If I&#x2019;m dealing with a person one-on-one, I just try to reflect their emotions; usually they&#x2019;re distracted enough by their own overflowing emotions not to notice my lack of them.</p> <p><strong>Q. Research shows that one in twenty-five people is a sociopath, yet most of us believe we&#x2019;ve never met one. Are we just kidding ourselves? Are you able to spot them?</strong></p> <p>A. Statistically, everyone has met at least one sociopath; in fact, most people will have a close encounter with a sociopath at some point in their lives, either as a friend, family member, or lover. Sometimes I can tell who they are. I find that many successful sociopaths will leave deliberate clues as to what they are, the thought being that only other sociopaths would recognize them. I think sociopaths, like serial killers, often have a yearning to be acknowledged for who they are. They want people to admire their exploits, and that is hard to get when they are completely hidden, so they make small compromises.</p><b>M. E.

And <i>Pontoon</i> is nothing less than a spectacular return to form?replete with a bowling ball-urn, a hot-air balloon, giant duck decoys, a flying Elvis, and, most importantly, Wally?s pontoon boat. As the wedding of the decade approaches (accompanied by wheels of imported cheese and giant shrimp shish kebabs), the good-loving people of Lake Wobegon do what they do best: drive each other slightly crazy.</p><p>In the little town of Lake Wobegon, a wedding is planned down to the last detail, from the cheese and p�t� to the flying Elvis to the pontoon boat. Meanwhile, a good Lutheran lady prepares to die, her daughter meets a lover at the Romeo Motel, and a delegation of renegade Lutheran pastors from Denmark comes to town.

After all, we&#x2019;ve already seen three treatments of this gritty noir story. First there was the 1998 graphic novel written by Max Allan Collins with art by Richard Piers Rayner. Next came the 2002 Sam Mendes-directed film starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. And then came Collins&#x2019; novelization of the movie. But it turns out the publisher of the novelization chopped about 30,000 words from Collins&#x2019; text to keep it from straying from the film version. Now Brash Books, a publishing house founded by novelists Lee Goldberg and Joel Goldman, has restored the missing text and released the novel as Collins intended it. The result is a richer and more satisfying version of the tale, one that combines the swift pace of the graphic novel with the well-developed father-son relationships of Mendes&#x2019; movie &#x2014; and that includes both additional hard-boiled dialogue and more historical context for the Depression-era story set in Al Capone&#x2019;s Illinois. And Collins&#x2019; writing, always crisp and vividly visual, is at its best here in &#x201c;Road to Perdition: The New, Expanded Novel.&#x201d;</p><h2>INTO LAOS</h2><p>An eyewitness account of the last major operation the Americans fought in Vietnam, focusing on the soldiers as individuals and on the previously neglected aspects of the battles that were not reported by the press</p><p>Nolan's first book of Vietnam War history, Battle For Hue (LJ 3/13/84) had many flaws: confused action, emphasis on gruesome detail, and poor overview. This work, with its comprehensive command history, clear action, and vivid but humane narrative, has none of those. The first all-South Vietnamese offensive into Laos in early 1971 produced both an interruption of Northern buildups and a test of Vietnamization of the war, but despite a 10-to-1 casualty ratio and tons of captured supplies was seen to be so savage and damaging to the South and to American support forces that much of the military and the press deemed it a defeat. Nolan's arguments that it had positive effects are well presented and convincing. A powerful and thoughtful history of a neglected action. Mel D.

Or what the connection is between rabbits and the Underworld? Noted Indian arts-and-crafts expert Mark Bahti has compiled a fascinating reference to answer hundreds of questions such as these about Native American fetishes and carvings. Part I introduces the tribes and their traditional uses of fetishes. Part II contains the stories and legends associated with the animals and other figures represented by fetish forms. Part III covers the materials used. To many of us, it&#39;s a collection of &#34;&#34;folk tales&#34;&#34; --where Badger gave corn its many colors and where Black Body used crystals to make the stars, which his helpers clean and replace each day. To America&#39;s indigenous people, it is the real world. Anyone who has glimpsed the depth of meaning in the traditions and cosmologies of their cultures will find a wealth of information in this richly illustrated handbook.</p><p>If you're looking for a handbook with larger-than-life full-color photographs of indigenous artwork, are fascinated by Native American spirituality and artifacts, or are interested in stone and stone sculpture, check out this attractively designed reference. Bahti brings it all together under one cover in a scholarly yet down-to-earth presentation of the Apache, Navajo, Zuni, Rio Grande Pueblos, Hopi, and Tohono O'odham peoples' stone fetish work. For the non-Native reader, the introduction is most helpful in understanding the respectfully appropriate attitude to take toward the religious and artistic practices of Native peoples. The chapter on materials is a valuable resource for the aspiring carver, and the detailed explanations and photos of each type of fetish are invaluable for the beginning collector. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>"This easy-to-use guide contains good information as well as beautiful color photos of contemporary examples of the small carvings. The book is organized in four parts: the role of these carvings to the various Southwestern tribal groups, explanations of the significance of the various animals, a discussion of other carved figures and objects, and materials employed. This is an attractive guide, with nice, silhouetted reproductions that do justice to the beautiful carvings. This is a good reference, certain to find its way to collectors' bookshelves. -- <i><i>New Mexico Magazine</i></i></p><h2>1 And 2 Samuel: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)</h2><p>Recipient of a 1990 Christianity Today Critics&#39; Choice Award!The stories of Samuel, Saul and David are among the most memorable in the Old Testament. Yet the lives of these individuals are wound up in the larger story of God&#39;s purpose for his people. Looking beyond the well-known surface of these stories Joyce Baldwin explores the meaning of the biblical history of Israel&#39;s vital transition from a confederation of tribes to nationhood under a king.Bible students at all levels will find that this commentary provides an excellent introduction to the critical issues of authorship, date, composition and structure of Samuel, as well as an able discussion of its theological themes. Written in a clear and straightforward style, here is a worthy addition to the acclaimed Tyndale Commentary Series.</p><p>Joyce G. Baldwin (B.A., B.D.) was principal of Trinity College, Bristol, and wrote several volumes in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary series. She died in 1996."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

Childermass stands to inherit his brother Peregrine's multimillion dollar estate, but only if he can stay on the estate all summer, plus interpret a cryptic rhyme. As usual, Bellairs salts the story with apparitions, vague warnings, deep forebodings, magic effects, tombs, corpses, and the like. The Bad Guy, Edmund Stallybrass, outwits Childermass and the boys at every turn, and finally locks them up in a burial vault and leaves them to die. Enter Crazy Annie, a local witch, who opens the vault, then in the climactic scene, confronts and kills Stallybrass in a wild play of spells and counterspells. Johnny, Fergie, and the professor don't have much to do here except rush about and explain to readers what's happening. The elements of plot and character are slapped together in an arbitrary, disjointed way that leaves plenty of unanswered questions and gaps in logic.

For too long, we the people have sat by and let politicians and bureaucrats from both parties obfuscate and lie. And according to this former Navy SEAL, former pro wrestler, and former Minnesota governor, the media is complicit in these acts of deception. For too long, the mainstream press has refused to consider alternate possibilities and to ask the tough questions. Here, Ventura looks closely at the theories that have been presented over the years and separates the fact from the fiction.<br><br> In Ventura&#x2019;s eyes, the murder of Abraham Lincoln and the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, all need to be re-examined. Was Watergate presented honestly, or was the CIA involved? Did the Republican Party set out to purposefully steal two elections on behalf of George W. Bush? Has all the evidence been presented about the 9/11 attacks or is there another angle that the media is afraid to explore? And finally, is the collapse of today&#x2019;s financial order and the bailout plan by the Federal Reserve the widest-reaching conspiracy ever perpetrated?<br><br> If you&#x2019;re talking outspoken, unconventional, and no-holds-barred, you&#x2019;re talking Jesse Ventura.&#x201d; Larry King<br> &nbsp;<br> I wouldn&#x2019;t mind seeing Ventura run for president (or for senator, or dog-catcher, or whatever).

Anent the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Ventura asserts that &#x201c;our government engaged in a massive cover-up&#x201d; and had &#x201c;ties to the hijackers.&#x201d; He ventures that &#x201c;unanswered questions remain about how the towers were brought down and whether a plane really struck the Pentagon&#x201d; and that the &#x201c;Bush Administration either knew about the plan&#x201d; or &#x201c;had a hand in it.&#x201d; Heady, paranoiac stuff, to be sure, but there are even more forthright charges regarding the assassination of Malcolm X, the Jonestown massacre, and the &#x201c;stolen&#x201d; elections of 2000, 2004, 2008, and, for that matter, 1980.

Now he declares it's time to admit that the capitalist engine is broken--that in its current form it inevitably leads to rampant inequality, massive unemployment, and environmental destruction. We need a new economic system that unleashes altruism as a creative force just as powerful as self-interest. <br> Is this a pipe dream? Not at all. In the last decade, thousands of people and organizations have already embraced Yunus's vision of a new form of capitalism, launching innovative social businesses designed to serve human needs rather than accumulate wealth. They are bringing solar energy to millions of homes in Bangladesh; turning thousands of unemployed young people into entrepreneurs through equity investments; financing female-owned businesses in cities across the United States; bringing mobility, shelter, and other services to the rural poor in France; and creating a global support network to help young entrepreneurs launch their start-ups. <br> In <i>A World of Three Zeros</i>, Yunus describes the new civilization emerging from the economic experiments his work has helped to inspire. He explains how global companies like McCain, Renault, Essilor, and Danone got involved with this new economic model through their own social action groups, describes the ingenious new financial tools now funding social businesses, and sketches the legal and regulatory changes needed to jumpstart the next wave of socially driven innovations. And he invites young people, business and political leaders, and ordinary citizens to join the movement and help create the better world we all dream of.</p><p><strong>Muhammad Yunus</strong>, a native of Bangladesh, was educated at Dhaka University and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University.

Still supple she felt, and almost warm. His only little bit of comfort. </p><p> In his left hand, the shovel. </p><p> Here and there he'd take hold with his right, grasp the smooth, red, strangely burnished trunk or limb of a manzanita for balance, for pull, gently pressing the fistful of shovel handle to her smooth flank to keep her from tumbling. The sun would be coming all too soon. </p><p> He'd kept this trail clear by his own maintenance and concern, hiking by day with a sheathed trail saw hanging on one side of his belt, a strong hinged clipper for smaller branches on the other. He knew this trail the way he'd known his Jenny, could navigate it in the dark, knowing by memory when to grasp, when to duck his head. </p><p> What few things Hayden knew, he knew. The rest was a mystery, pure and simple. </p><p> As he grasped and ducked he cursed himself, and his burning chest, and promised himself he'd quit smoking again, this time for real, and touched his shirt pocket, wondering if he'd remembered to bring the pack along. It both comforted and disgusted him to feel it there. He'd lean on them now, because he needed to; then, in a day or a week, he'd reclaim his stolen wind. </p><p> He reached the saddle of the ridge, the clearing he'd created and maintained, and gently spread her on her side on the cool ground and sat for a moment before going to work. Sat by her side and fired up what he hoped would be one of the last, and set the shovel across his knees, hating the finality of the whole deal. And touched one hand to her cooling side, wishing the sun was up so he could enjoy her smooth blue coat with his eyes and not just his hand. He drew hard on the cigarette tucked deep between his first fingers, watching the red tip glow, hating the way the hot smoke soothed him going down. </p><p> Maybe his eyes had adjusted to the dark, or maybe that odd moment of predawn had found them, because Hayden noticed he could nearly make out the silhouettes of buckbrush, the gnarled shapes and nature-sanded smoothness of the manzanita branches. He felt his thinking change about Jenny. He did not wish to see her, not now. Not like this. And the dawn would bring the heat of the day, the enemy, tormentor of men with shovels. No. It wasn't dawn. Couldn't be. Still long too early for that. But it would be, sometime. He had better get started. </p><p> For one brief moment he allowed himself to think about Laurel, let himself feel the need, a touch or a word from her to fill the ache of this moment. Hayden told no one, not even Laurel, when he ached, but he often ached for his ache to be seen, to be known by her. To be cooled and settled. </p><p> He put the urge away again but it left an echo, the blank, unfilled shock of a craving deferred. </p><p> He set about to dig in the hard ground.<br> </p><p> Hayden stared down at his hands, at black dirt still packed underneath the nails, ground deep into the calluses of his palms. He didn't mind dirt, not as such. He minded the lack of sleep, the sandy eyes and dicey stomach from staying up the night, challenging the dry soil inch by inch. He minded that Laurel would come soon to start the cinnamon rolls in the half dark, in the barely-morning light, and what if she reached for him or allowed him to reach for her? What, then, would he do with all this dirt? </p><p> More even than this, he minded his Jenny in the ground, lost to him. Minded it so much he could not permit his mind to complete that revolution, to spin its gears around to the new, real, entirely changed day. He needed instead to stay mired a few more moments in that foggy no-man's-land, like the moment between sleep and waking when a vivid dream slides away, one unlikely image at a time. </p><p> He sat in the dawn in the cab of his old pickup and waited for her to unlock the diner's back door, thinking, Where will I wash my hands, in case I get to touch her? It was a good moment to cry, or would have been, anyway. Only for one thing, though. Hayden didn't cry. Never had, as long as he could remember. Didn't figure at this late date he ever would. </p><p> Even Hayden's mother, whom he hadn't seen since he was nineteen, had told him the story time and time again, along with anyone else who would listen. Maybe when you were in diapers, she would say. But after that, nothing. Not even if you hurt yourself bad. Which was usually. Not even when you broke both your legs that time. And it's a funny thing, she would add, because you were always the most deep-down oddly emotional boy anybody'd ever met. Just no tears. </p><p> He sat looking out across the long valley, smoking a cigarette, sighting along the endless line of electrical towers. They always looked like headless lattice giants to him. Long legs slightly spread, short arms extended, strands of wires dangling from their fingers and dipping slightly between towers, traveling off into infinity. Every year some fool kids tried to climb them. A combination of rural boredom and some strange rite of new manhood Hayden wished he didn't understand. This year some poor kid paid the price, which was going to happen sooner or later. Rumor had it his watch was still up there somewhere, half melted and fused forever to that unremorseful steel. Even the crystal melted. Hayden didn't know which tower, and he damn sure wasn't going up to look, but it was possible. He knew such a thing could happen. </p><p> He looked in his rearview mirror to see the sun just cresting the mountain ridge, the highway clear in that still air, and an animal worrying over something right on the centerline. An odd sight. And it felt good to be distracted, to wonder over somebody else's problem for a change. </p><p> A cat, he decided. Moving a kitten across the highway. Hurry, Hayden thought. It's a mean highway. It's a headlight zone. One of those flat two-lane stretches in the middle of nowhere on which motorists are instructed to run their headlights by day. Only way anybody can think to cut the fatalities. Nobody wants to just do nothing, but how much can you do? People die on highways. It's what happens. </p><p> Hayden stepped out of his old pickup and watched the lights of a big rig bear down from the east. Move, cat, he thought, but it wasn't a cat with a kitten, it was a possum. Mother and baby. Which was too bad. A cat he could pick up and move. But possums. Vicious little bastards when threatened. Razor-sharp little teeth. </p><p> The rig roared down, and Hayden watched, a bit detached. Somewhat confused. They would move. Of course they would move. Momma possum held her tiny one, eyes barely open, in her teeth, but it squirmed free. Hayden moved closer. Not squirmed, he saw. Convulsed. Something wrong with the baby. Maybe it had been hit already. It seemed to stiffen into little seizures that made it impossible to handle. </p><p> Momma possum seemed to know the truck was coming. Death, motherhood -- Hayden knew it must be hard to decide. When the headlights fell full across her she abandoned her young and ran. It was late, nearly too late, really, but Hayden stepped into the road and picked it up. It weighed a few ounces at most; it was soft. He jumped back, not even thinking it might bite him. Thinking more about his near miss with the semi. The deep, shocking blare of the truck's air horn pressed into his ears; the wind of the passing monster flapped his big shirt about. The driver flipped Hayden the finger out the window as he blew by. </p><p> Hayden only smiled. </p><p> The baby possum did not try to bite him. It stiffened into another convulsion in his palm, tiny eyes closed, feeling soft and looking ratlike but innocent. He put it in his shirt pocket, where it seized against his chest. He wanted to return it to the mother but couldn't see where she had gone. </p><p> He wondered if it could feel his heart beat.<br> </p><p> Old Dr. Meecham, the veterinarian, lived over his storefront office. Hayden leaned on his truck horn until Meecham came to the window to ask what the hell gives. </p><p> "Oh, you," he said. The lights came on upstairs and in time he shuffled down. </p><p> A hard glare of full morning assaulted Hayden's eyes from the east, over the flat valley landscape; the day's heat already more than threatened. They stood outside, boots in the dirt, two big men hovering over a few ounces of sudden trouble. Meecham wore a shock of pure white hair still tumbled from his pillow. </p><p> "Momma abandoned it, huh? That'll happen," the doc said. "Born wrong somehow. They know to let it go." </p><p> Hayden didn't bother to say this lady was loath to let go, like Hayden himself with his Jenny, Meecham being a logical sort of a fellow. Some of us, Hayden considered, aren't fortunate enough to possess that cool luxury. </p><p> "Some kind of seizures. Want me to put it out of its misery." Meecham told this as a fact, didn't ask it. </p><p> "No, I want you to fix it." </p><p> "Not everything's fixable, Hayden." </p><p> Don't I know it, he thought. "You're the veterinarian. You're the one supposed to know how." </p><p> "Well, leave it here. I'll see what can be done. Might cost." </p><p> Everything costs, Hayden told himself, money being the least of it. "I'm prepared to cover it." </p><p> "Don't get your hopes too high. Sure you want it saved? Just what we need around here, another possum." </p><p> "Do what you can, Doc." </p><p> "Be under somebody's wheels on the highway tomorrow. Born roadkill they are. Just the way of the world, Hayden." </p><p> "You do what you can," Hayden said, one carefully formed word after another, trying to keep the reasonableness from draining out of his voice. </p><p> He walked back to his truck, scuffing his boot toes in the dirt, thinking he must've missed Laurel's arrival at the shop by now, that quiet, untouched moment before life wakes up and shuffles around, disturbing their chances. He said inside himself, That little mass of fur will never grasp the sacrifice. </p><p> "How's that good-looking bluetick hound of yours?" Meecham called to his back. </p><p> Hayden drove away and did not answer.<br> </p><p> When he arrived back at the diner her station wagon was there, along with the car that belonged to the morning waitress. </p><p> He stuck his head in the back door and just stood that way a minute, watching Laurel roll the big flat sheet of dough for this morning's cinnamon rolls. </p><p> He was that late. </p><p> He wondered what might be about to transpire, and whether or not it would hurt. It seemed more or less an even draw, like flipping a coin. Or so the past had taught him. </p><p> She addressed him, never once looking up. "Not like you to sleep in." </p><p> "I haven't slept yet." </p><p> She looked up, as if to confirm or deny that information with her own two eyes; she seemed convinced once she saw his face. He wanted to tell her about Jenny, but it seemed like the morning had already set off in the wrong direction, almost before he'd opened his mouth. So he just stepped inside and watched her work. Watched the place where her apron tied snug at the belt line of her jeans, a pleasingly narrow waist, and the way her hair, kind of brown but red, a dark brown with deep red highlights, had already begun to come apart from the simple way she'd pinned it up this morning. It was better, anyway, apart, mussed looking. It reminded him of other mussed moments, and made his stomach hurt. </p><p> He wished she would say something, or that he would. </p><p> He moved closer, around her side of the wood table, and slid one arm around her waist, heavy to breaking with his need to do that, but just then the swinging door to the front flew open and the waitress came through. Laurel ducked away from him, he wasn't entirely sure why. He was never entirely sure if they were a secret or not. If they were anything or not. </p><p> They waited for the waitress to bustle around and take what she needed and go again. Hayden stood close enough to Laurel to smell her, not perfume exactly but something like it, that blend of soap and shampoo and Laurel that wouldn't come out the same on any other woman, or in his head on a lonely night. It just could not be reproduced. </p><p> "This is not a great time," she said when the girl had gone. "Jack'll be in any minute. Anyway, we need to talk." </p><p> The words collected in his stomach, gained weight, and settled hard. And then he saw it. Looked down at her hands gone back to slicing cinnamon rolls from the coil of dough, and there it was, half covered with flour, but there all the same. He grabbed her left hand hard and held it close under his face, in case it was only an illusion, and proximity might break it apart, make it go away. But it was still her wedding band. It wouldn't leave him alone all that easy. He felt dizzy, like he might pass out, but in the end was not nearly so fortunate. </p><p> "You couldn't have told me about this?" </p><p> "I'm trying to tell you about it right now. Could you let go my hand, please? You're hurting me." </p><p> "Oh. Sorry." He dropped her hand and dropped his own hands to his sides, and looked up to see Jack standing in the doorway, watching them. "I was just leaving," Hayden said. </p><p> At the doorway Jack did not step out of his way. They stood like that a moment, nearly nose to nose, maintaining eye contact in the manner that any animal will know to do in such a bind. Jack was good looking, which didn't help, with that shiny kind of pretty-boy looks. He had a fifteen-year age advantage on Hayden, but Hayden had a couple of inches and maybe fifty pounds of bulk on Jack. Just for that moment Hayden wouldn't have minded throwing all that into the fray, just to see what would prove more important than what. Wouldn't have minded a bit. </p><p> "Guys," Laurel said, which broke up those thoughts and knocked Hayden onto a different train of action. </p><p> "You're in my way, Jack," he said, and Jack took one step to the side to let him pass. Just as he did, Jack bumped Hayden's shoulder hard with his own, but Hayden just kept walking, at least until it was time to drive. </p><p><br> It was too soon to go back to Meecham's, Hayden knew. Yet he went back there all the same. Where else would he go? Home, to an empty cabin? To no Laurel, no Jenny, no buffer for this roiling disarray spilling around inside him, where it could do harm to himself or others? Better to use himself in some way. If only this had been a working day. If only this had not fallen on his day off from the hardware store, but so it did. </p><p> Meecham's assistant was nowhere to be seen. Meecham himself came out from the back examination room, wiping his hands on his lab smock and shaking his head. </p><p> "Gone, Hayden. Sorry." He didn't say it so much like he felt deeply sorry, more like he was sorry to have to tell Hayden something Hayden didn't care to know. </p><p> "Seizures killed it?" </p><p> "Well, I -- " </p><p> "What exactly killed it?" </p><p> "Can't save everything, Hayden." </p><p> Now it began to rise in him, that hard disdain for being gently tutored in something he knew better than anybody. Meecham stood close up on the other side of the front counter now, and Hayden wanted him to stand farther back.

Or, to borrow another phrase, it's about life, the Universe, and everything." --<i>The Times <br></i><br>� "Satirical, historical, fantastical and irresistible." --<i>Daily Mail <br><br></i>� "The subject matter is football, with a dash of Romeo and Juliet... exactly what's needed to cheer us all up in the autumnal gloom.

As renowned author Scott Cunningham plainly states, the practice of magic is not supernatural or Satanic. Witches and folk magicians are only utilizing, through timeless rituals, natural energies found within the Earth and our bodies to enrich life by creating positive change. It's all revealed here in the easy-to-read, understandable style that was Scott Cunningham's trademark.</p> <p><strong>Praise:</strong><br>"A really good introduction to Witchcraft and Wicca...I thought it was wonderful."&#x2015;Marian Zimmer Bradley, author of <em>The Mists of Avalon</em></p> <p>"...[T]he first book I recommend to those seeking information about my religion."&#x2015;Ellen Cannon Reed, <em>The Witches' Tarot</em></p> <p>"One of the best introductory books about Witchcraft and folk magic."&#x2015;The Broom Closet, BroomCloset.com</p></p><p>Today, many people consider Witchcraft to be one of the fastest-growing religions in the world. Articles in newspapers and magazines, as well as movies and shows on television, are filled with Witchcraft. Or rather, what is supposed to be Witchcraft. <br> <br>I have been involved with Witchcraft for over a quarter of a century and am surprised and disappointed that Wicca is still misunderstood, feared, and even hated. <br> <br>We asked Scott Cunningham to write <i>The Truth About Witchcraft Today </i>to help dispel misconceptions and give honest answers to those seeking to follow the Wiccan way. Already, over 135,000 people have used this book for one or both of these purposes. If you're interested in becoming a Witch, or want to know the truth about what Witches do, you should get this book too. <br> <br>This is not meant to be an in-depth study of Wicca. It is an introductory book so you can have the basics: What takes place in Wiccan rituals? What type of magic do Witches use? What holidays do Witches celebrate? What are the deities worshiped by Wiccans? <br> <br>It's all revealed here, and it's done in the easy-to-read, understandable style that has helped to make Cunningham famous. <br> <br>One of the purposes I have always hoped this book would fulfill is to help younger people let their parents and friends know that they aren't doing anything illegal or immoral. (In fact, real Witchcraft is a highly ethical religion which stresses personal responsibility for one's actions.) This book will help explain exactly what they are doing. <br> <br>So, if your parents or friends are open to hearing about what you do and what you believe, here is the perfect book to give to them. It may counter any doubt or distrust. And opening any person's mind to the truth is a good thing in and of itself. <br> <br>Scott Cunningham practiced magic actively for over twenty years. He was the author of more than fifty books covering both fiction and non-fiction subject matter; sixteen of his titles are published by Llewellyn Publications. Scott's books reflect a broad range of interests within the New Age sphere, where he was very highly regarded. He passed from this life on March 28, 1993, after a long illness. <br></p><h2>Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess</h2><p>New Orleans is a gardener's paradise. Fragrant ginger and night-blooming jessamine scent the air. Nary a crack in the cement or divot in the wall is free from rogue ferns, mosses, or draping greenery. For generations, residents from wildly varied cultures and sensibilities have been at work creating magnificent gardens throughout the city. <i>New Orleans Gardens</i> explores this rich history and tours public gardens, as well as opens the doors to lovingly tended private balcony, patio, and mansion grounds. Interviews discuss the environmental and cultural forces that shaped the gardens. In photography as sumptuous as his acclaimed New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Richard Sexton vividly illustrates the many traditions interwoven in this bewitching city's landscape heritage.</p><p><i>Fragrant</i>. <i>Lush</i>. <i>Seductive</i>. Can these words describe any city other than New Orleans? With new plant life bursting from every cranny and ancient cypress trees, the gardens here present many unusual combinations of freshness and decay. <i>Gardens of New Orleans</i> has captured this magnificence in full glory, with page after page of beautifully green photographs. <p> Authors Lake Douglas and Jeannette Hardy include historical sketches, maps, and photographs that provide an informative introduction to the city. The outdoor French Market photographs show piles of fruit you can almost taste, even if the picture is in sepia tones. The section on public spaces follows, bringing glossy color photos of charming statuary and enormous live oaks that are memorable both for their size and grace. The final chapter is filled with close-up shots of many private gardens in the city, and show off the best New Orleans has to offer: peaceful balconies, bright flowers, antique ornaments, and artfully trimmed hedges. The lovely Ursiline convent is included in this section, with its glowing white statues and peaceful paths for meditation.</p><p> In every case, photographer Richard Sexton has captured the remarkable light as it filters through the trees. His close-ups clearly show the vines and sprouts popping up between bricks and under older plants, while his landscapes showcase both the heavy greenery and the well-known cast-iron decorations on houses, fences, and furniture. Whether you're a New Orleans native or simply love impossibly green gardens, this lovely book will bring the rich flavor of this charming city to your living room. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Lake Douglas a garden historian living in New Orleans and writes for numerous architecture and garden publications.</p><h2>BodyWork Shiatsu: Bringing the Art of Finger Pressure to the Massage Table</h2><p>For the first time, an expert in the Asian art of finger-pressure massage shifts the practice of shiatsu from the floor to the massage table--increasing the comfort of the patient, conserving the energy of the therapist, and augmenting the effects of the treatment. Skillfully integrating current Western scientific research with traditional energetic concepts and techniques of shiatsu, Carl Dubitsky provides a new perspective on this ancient healing art. His analysis of the muscular anatomy of the points and pathways is unique in Western literature, making shiatsu techniques more accessible and comprehensible to health professionals and bodyworkers of all schools. <br><br><i>BodyWork Shiatsu</i> grounds its discussion of shiatsu in a thorough review of traditional Asian medical theory, explaining the concepts of yin and yang, the five elements, and the flow of life energy, <i>qi</i>, along with the meridians of the body. These concepts form the basis of the health professional's approach to examination and treatment. The heart of the book contains detailed instructions in applying shiatsu to the massage table--from basic finger technique to choosing equipment--with specific recommendations for treating each part of the body. The fruit of the author's many years of immersion in both Eastern and Western systems of massage, <i>BodyWork Shiatsu</i> is an invaluable aid to all those interested in advanced applications of shiatsu as well as those wishing to incorporate basic principles of finger-pressure massage into their health-care practice.</p><p>Director of the Healthsprings Clinic in Boulder, Colorado, Carl Dubitsky has studied and practiced shiatsu, Amma, and martial arts massage for more than 20 years under such widely known Asian masters as Koichi Nakamura, Eizo Ninomiya, DoAnn T. Kaneko, and Soo Se Cho, in addition to studies at the Swedish Institute for Medical Massage in New York City and advanced work with Owen James, an original student of Ida Rolf.

He meets brave Ratty, kind old Badger, and the rascally Mr. Toad, and together they go adventuring . . . <i>The Wind in the Willows </i>is a classic animal adventure that charms and enthralls. This edition contains the original illustrations by E. H. Shepard, a partnership that has never been bettered.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

Democratic, apolitical and unique, the archive of thousands of images offers an engrossing and engaging cross-section of society.</p><p>Over the course of the last two decades, the Dutch photographer worked methodically on his monumental Photo Notes project: First he would select a busy pedestrian area &#x2013; his favorite spots were often near shopping centers &#x2013; where he would stay for 30 minutes up to a few hours. He then spent time observing passers-by before recognizing a common type, normally based on a garment, sometimes a behavior: people in band T&#x2010;shirts, fur caps or beige trench coats; young couples walking arm in arm; women in suit dresses; men with gelled hair or pushing shopping trolleys. . . He snapped them with a camera hung around his neck, attached to a trigger in his pocket. Back in the studio, the images were laid into grids called Photo Notes. Their simplicity of form and presentation belies their complex anthropological, social and artistic commentary.</p></p><p><p>David Carrier is an American philosopher and art and culture critic.

They were the men and women of the Red Army, a ragtag mass of soldiers who confronted Europe's most lethal fighting force and by 1945 had defeated it. Sixty years have passed since their epic triumph, but the heart and mind of Ivan--as the ordinary Russian soldier was called--remain a mystery. We know something about hoe the soldiers died, but nearly nothing about how they lived, how they saw the world, or why they fought. <br> Drawing on previously closed military and secret police archives, interviews with veterans, and private letters and diaries, Catherine Merridale presents the first comprehensive history of the Red Army rank and file. She follows the soldiers from the shock of the German invasion to their costly triumph in Stalingrad, where life expectancy was often a mere twenty-four hours. Through the soldiers' eyes, we witness their victorious arrival in Berlin, where their rage and suffering exact an awful toll, and accompany them as they return home full of hope, only to be denied the new life they had been fighting to secure.<br> A tour de force of original research and a gripping history, <i>Ivan's War</i> reveals the singular mixture of courage, patriotism, anger, and fear that made it possible for these underfed, badly led troops to defeat the Nazi army. In the process Merridale restores to history the invisible millions who sacrificed the most to win the war.<br><br></p><p>Catherine Merridale is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Night of Stone</i>, winner of Britain's Heinemann Award for Literature.

Their stories seldom correspond to reality, but forecasting is not the purpose. Instead, the idea that the boys will soon be back or that the enemy will be destroyed with surgical precision, like the myth that it will all be over by Christmas, serves to foster a confident, even optimistic, mood at times when gloom might be more natural. In 1938, as the momentum for large-scale war gathered, the citizens of Stalin's empire, like Europeans everywhere, attempted to allay their fears with comforting tales. The Soviet vision of future conflict was destined to inspire a generation of wartime volunteers, but the images were created deliberately, by a clique of leaders whose ideology had set them on the path to international hostilities. The favored medium of communication was the cinema. The epic struggle of utopia and backwardness played out in moving pictures, black and white, with stirring music swelling on the soundtrack. At other moments, Soviet people opened their newspapers to columns of portentous diplomatic reportage; their country was preparing for battle. Butthough the news available to citizens was full of threat, films were designed to inculcate the view that the people's vanguard, the Red Army, was certain to triumph, and very quickly, too.The greatest epic of the time was Sergei Eisenstein's <i>Alexander Nevsky</i>, an anti-Fascist parable of Russian victory over German invaders. Although it is set in the thirteenth century, in the age of Slavic princes and Teutonic knights, Eisenstein's great spectacle, released in 1938, makes direct reference to the politics of the 1930s, even to the point of adding swastikas to some of the Teutonic knights' shields and standards. The message was not one that Soviet audiences, attuned to every nuance of state-controlled propaganda, would miss. For all its deliberate sermonizing, however, the film, which boasted a musical score by Sergei Prokofiev, endured as a classic of Soviet cinema. Inferior productions with similar themes stood the test of time less well. But in the 1930s their audiences were rapt. And while, on the surface at least, <i>Alexander Nevsky</i> was set in the deep past, for moviegoers who preferred to look forward, another film, Efim Dzigan's <i>If There Is War Tomorrow</i>, also released in 1938, foretold Russia's victory in the face of a future invasion, the one that kept people awake at nights.Efim Dzigan set out to reassure. The impact of his hour-long film was created by blending fictitious action with clips of genuine newsreel, splicing documentary footage into an unfolding fantasy of effortless victory. The message--resolute and stoical but also full of hope--was strengthened by the repetition of a musical refrain with words by the popular songwriter Vasily Lebedev-Kumach.1 <i>If There Is War Tomorrow</i> struck so live a chord with Soviet audiences that they went on watching it even after the real war began. By the winter of 1941, the invader had overrun a third of Soviet territory. The planes that droned across Dzigan's black-and-white screen had been destroyed, the tanks burned out, the brave soldiers corralled in prison camps. It was no longer possible to dream that this war would be over soon. That winter, the audiences crowding into old schoolrooms and empty huts included evacuees from Ukraine and Smolensk, people whose homes were now in German hands. Huddled together, relying on one another's breath for warmth, they needed patience as the hand-cranked dynamo was turned. All the same, a spell seemed to be cast.2 This film was not about the war butabout faith. That faith, and the images that sustained it, was part of what defined the generations that would bear the brunt of Russia's war. In the terrible years ahead, people would hum the music from the film to keep their spirits up. As they marched across dusty steppe, as they strummed guitars by the light of a campfire, it would be Lebedev-Kumach's song that soldiers often sang.The film's action begins in a fairground, probably the newly opened Gorky Park, Moscow's Park of Culture and Rest. The Kremlin towers are visible in the distance, each topped with a glowing electric star. It is night, but the city is full of jollity, with Ferris wheels and fireworks and young people strolling about with ice creams in their hands. This is the socialist paradise, and it is a place of well-earned leisure, happy couples, brightly colored food. There is an innocence about it, crimeless, sexless, blandly without sin. In this land, Stalin and his loyal aides do all the worrying so that the children of the revolution can be free. But their freedom is under threat. The film cuts to the Soviet border, where Fascist troops, antlike, are climbing into tanks. There is no chance that we will sympathize with them. These are not the seductive species of villain but absurd buffoons. Their officers wear large mustaches, look pompous, and move with the bowlegged gait of cavalrymen. The infantrymen crawl, the airmen stoop. Throughout the action, they speak German, but they are more like cartoon Prussians from a children's book than genuine leather-booted Nazis. Even the swastikas on their helmets and collars are slightly eccentric. This is picture-book Fascism, not the real thing.The invasion takes place at night. It could be frightening, and we may briefly worry for the stout young woman who is making soup a stone's throw from the front, but border guards hold the aggressor at bay. Our housewife joins the men, throwing off her apron and taking her place in the line of skillful gunners, proving that patriots can turn their hands to anything. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning of a series of perfidious attacks. The next comes from the air. The Fascist biplanes buzz with menace, but danger is averted for a second time. Soviet planes, a fleet of shining new machines, take to the skies, and at this point the audience should recognize the aces who have rushed to pilot them. There is Babushkin, the hero of an arctic rescue missionseveral years before, and Vodopyanov and Gromov, star aviators, their names printed across the screen in case we did not manage to identify their faces right away. The 1930s were the age of heroes, and pilots were the true elite. In a scene whose irony would become apparent three years later, when the Luftwaffe mounted its devastating attacks of June and July 1941, the famous aces run audacious raids into the Fascists' lair, destroying enemy aircraft on the ground and flying home without a single loss.And now it is the Red Army's own turn. The volunteers stream in from every corner of the Soviet land. There is an old man with a gray beard in the line for recruitment. He fought against the White general Anton Denikin in the civil war and he wants another crack at the enemy. He holds a fist toward the screen, assuring us that the villains "will remember this from last time." The Fascists, like the Whites, have become the sworn enemies of right-thinking citizens everywhere. But not all citizens are fit to fight, and we now learn that front-line service is to be regarded as a privilege. Working and waiting are the lot of older people and the very young. Some women will remain at home, too, but others, every bit as trained and warlike as the men, line up in uniform, jaws set, prepared to do great deeds. It is not just Russians who come forward. The commissar for defense, Kliment Voroshilov, appears in his best uniform and appeals to the peoples of the east, the Uzbeks in particular. Hard-bitten men in sheepskin hats respond at once. Voroshilov's speech becomes a turning point for everyone. Soon Soviet troops will attack, driving the Fascists from their trenches. The war is going to be fought on the aggressor's soil, and it is going to be won.The story never gets more frightening than that. Whenever Soviet forces engage with the enemy, the Fascists end up running for their lives. Not all the fighting is high-tech, and in fact the biggest set-piece battle in the film involves cavalry and bayonets, but there is no blood. Indeed, there is only one serious wounding. Its victim is a member of a tank crew who joined up in the first wave, together with his brother, and set off eagerly for adventure. The men--accompanied by a pretty young nurse--spend a few moments trundling happily along in their Soviet tank, a surprisingly spacious vehicle with a cabin that looks like the inside of a trailer. They could be heading off on holiday, even at the pointwhen their machine grinds to a sudden halt. Our hero, smooth and cheerful as a young Elvis Presley, is undaunted. He grabs a handy wrench and climbs out through the hatch. There is a bang, the sound of a man at work, and though we cannot see the actor we can hear him whistling the theme song as he puts the problem right. But then the music stops in a flurry of gunfire. Inside, the brother's face sets in a mask of grief. A couple of seconds of suspense follow, accompanied by violins, so we may catch our breath in expectation of a tragedy. But Stalin's children need not cry for long. The young man's hand has been hurt, but that is all. Once he has climbed back in and the nurse has bandaged him, he is as good as new. The whole crew starts the song again, and off they go to win the war.The story ends in Berlin. Soviet planes, wave after wave of them, are flying in formation like so many wild geese. They are not dropping bombs. Their payload is made up of leaflets calling on the population to put down their arms and join the international proletarian socialist revolution. The message is timely, for on the ground a large meeting is already under way. The workers in this other land are preparing to break the chains of capitalism. Slogans fill the screen. War, we are told, will lead to the destruction of the capitalist world. The fighting will not take place on Soviet soil. These reassuring messages are backed up by fanfares and more banners. The audience is smiling; it is saved. As the music fades, another slogan reminds us that the price of freedom is to be prepared for war. To be prepared, that is, to ride to Berlin in a shiny tank, to be a handsome pilot or a pretty nurse, to point a gun at a healthy man and shoot him down without spilling a single drop of blood.The dream of quick and easy victory might not have been so potent if it had remained confined to the big screen. It might not have been quite so devastating, either. The problem, by 1938, was that the fantasy had affected real strategic thinking. "Decisive victory at low cost" was not just a vision of the propagandists; it was the Red Army's official goal. Dzigan's script may have helped to inure citizens to war, but less constructively it was also the scenario for a generation of military thinkers. In 1937, when Stalin replaced his leading strategists with people chosen for their political, as opposed to purely military, distinction, a new approach to national security was adopted in Moscow. In the past, a gooddeal of planning had gone into strategies for defense. Now the entire orientation of Red Army training was directed at offensive operations. The plans and training exercises needed for prolonged defense were scaled down, as were the fledgling preparations for partisan operations inside Soviet territory.3 The notion that the enemy would be repelled and beaten on his own soil was not just a romantic dream; from the late 1930s it was the centerpiece of Stalinist military planning.It was as if a whole people shared a delusion. As Hitler and his generals were drilling the greatest professional army on the continent, Stalin's advisers seemed lost in fantasy. There had been dissident voices--powerful ones--but by 1938 the critics had vanished into the silence of the prison camps, the covert graves. If the Bolsheviks could win the civil war, the propagandists shrieked, if they could dam the Dnepr, banish God, and fly to the North Pole, then surely they could keep the Fascist invader at bay. History, the ineluctable drive that was moving all humanity toward a common goal, was on their side, after all. The delusion was expressed in many other films of the era, including one that features yet more tanks. In this production, <i>The Tank Men</i>, the hero, Karasev, is ordered to make a reconnaissance raid across the enemy lines. But he decides to go beyond the call of duty. He engages the sinister enemy in battle, cripples a few machines, and then drives on toward Berlin. When he gets there, he pushes on into the Reichstag and takes Hitler prisoner. "Well done, Karasev," his mates applaud when he returns. "There's not a damn thing left for us to do!"4In 1938, the audiences who watched these films would leave the hall and step into a real Russian night. The cheerful crowds and well-lit parks that people had seen on the screen would be nowhere in evidence. Instead, their path home would lead through bleak construction sites, along the muddy paths between poor peasant shacks, or past desolate streets where lights glimmered for just a few blocks before they gave in to the dark. Many would be going home to apartments so crowded that two families and three generations were packed into one room. Others, the young, might well be finding their way back to dormitories, barrack style, where dozens of boarders slept in rows. The revolution had not made these Russians rich. It had not even made their land the great industrial power of its own boast, although the rate ofchange was prodigious, the output staggering. But what distinguished them from other hard-pressed workers struggling to survive was the belief that they were the chosen. They might be hungry, ill-shod, crowded into slums, but they were working to transform the world. They had to win. That was the public face of Soviet culture, anyway.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Soviet state was born in war. If any nation should have known the face of violence, it was this one. First there had been the tsar's war against Germany, in which more Russian soldiers died than those of any other European state.5 The prospect of defeat in this, the First World War, along with the hardship that came with the war effort, sparked the riots of February 1917, the outburst of popular rage that toppled the tsar and swept a new government into power. But it took yet another upheaval, the Bolshevik coup under Lenin, to bring the tsar's exhausted troops back home. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which the new state dropped its former allies, Britain and France, in favor of a truce with Germany, brought peace for a few weeks at the beginning of 1918. Those servicemen who had not managed to desert rejoiced at the news that they no longer had to fight. But civil war followed, a conflict that blazed across the future Soviet world like a consuming fire, recalling soldiers to the colors and conscripting bystanders of every age. Its violence, more bitter even than conventional fighting, was only one aspect of this new war's cruelty. Wrecked towns and villages were also ravaged by epidemics--typhus in particular--while harvests failed and entire regions starved. By 1921, when the fighting ended in all but the last corners of the emergent state, most Soviet people knew exactly what war really meant.The greatest promise of the new regime was peace.

THE REBEL WHO BECAME A SOLDIER. THE SOLDIER WHO BECAME AN ICON. THE ICON WHO DISAPPEARED. </b><br> <br>Raised in Park Avenue privilege, J. D. Salinger sought out combat, surviving five bloody battles of World War II, and out of that crucible he created a novel, <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, which journeyed deep into his own despair and redefined postwar America.<br> <br>For more than fifty years, Salinger has been one of the most elusive figures in American history. All of the attempts to uncover the truth about why he disappeared have been undermined by a lack of access and the recycling of inaccurate information. In the course of a nine-year investigation, and especially in the three years since Salinger&#x2019;s death, David Shields and Shane Salerno have interviewed more than 200 people on five continents (many of whom had previously refused to go on the record) to solve the mystery of what happened to Salinger.<br> <br>Constructed like a thriller, this oral biography takes you into Salinger&#x2019;s private world for the first time, through the voices of those closest to him: his World War II brothers-in-arms, his family, his friends, his lovers, his classmates, his editors, his <i>New Yorker</i> colleagues, his spiritual advisors, and people with whom he had relationships that were secret even to his own family. Their intimate recollections are supported by more than 175 photos (many never seen before), diaries, legal records, and private documents that are woven throughout; in addition, appearing here for the first time, are Salinger&#x2019;s &#x201c;lost letters&#x201d;&#x2014;ranging from the 1940s to 2008, revealing his intimate views on love, literature, fame, religion, war, and death, and providing a raw and revelatory self-portrait.<br> <br>Salinger published his last story in 1965 but kept writing continuously until his death, locked for years inside a bunker in the woods, compiling manuscripts and filing them in a secret vault. Was he a genius who left the material world to focus on creating immaculate art or a haunted recluse, lost in his private obsessions? Why did this writer, celebrated by the world, stop publishing? Shields and Salerno&#x2019;s investigation into Salinger&#x2019;s epic life transports you from the bloody beaches of Normandy, where Salinger landed under fire, carrying the first six chapters of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> . . . to the hottest nightclub in the world, the Stork Club, where he romanced the beautiful sixteen-year-old Oona O&#x2019;Neill until she met Charlie Chaplin . . . from his top-secret counterintelligence duties, which took him to a subcamp of Dachau . . . to a love affair with a likely Gestapo agent whom he married and brought home to his Jewish parents&#x2019; Park Avenue apartment and photographs of whom appear here for the first time . . . from the pages of the <i>New Yorker</i>, where he found his voice by transforming the wounds of war into the bow of art . . . to the woods of New Hampshire, where the Vedanta religion took over his life and forced his flesh-and-blood family to compete with his imaginary Glass family.<br> <br>Deepening our understanding of a major literary and cultural figure, and filled with many fascinating revelations&#x2014; including the birth defect that was the real reason Salinger was initially turned down for military service; the previously unknown romantic interest who was fourteen when Salinger met her and, he said, inspired the title character of &#x201c;For Esm�&#x2014;with Love and Squalor&#x201d;; the first photographs ever seen of Salinger at war and the last known photos of him alive; never-before-published love letters that Salinger, at fifty-three, wrote to an eighteen-year-old Joyce Maynard; and, finally, what millions have been waiting decades for: the contents of his legendary vault&#x2014;<i>Salinger</i> is a monumental book about the cost of war and the cost of art.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2013:</strong> Salinger-ians &#x2013; those who are obsessed with the fabulously successful and famously reclusive Catcher in the Rye author&#x2013; will find much to argue about in this oral history by filmmaker Shane Salerno (whose related movie is released September 6) and co-writer David Shields. According to the authors and the dozens of people they interviewed, Salinger was an adolescent-girl-obsessed, religious fanatic who suffered from a kind of lifelong PTSD from his years in WWII as well as an embarrassing (to him) physical deformity; he also, according to the authors, used his reclusiveness to his own advantage, stepping out to the press and public when it suited him and the mythology they contend he at least partially created. But even those who couldn&#x2019;t care less about &#x201c;the finest mind ever to stay in prep school,&#x201d; (Norman Mailer) will find themselves surprisingly engaged: from snippets about Salinger&#x2019;s thwarted love affair with Eugene O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s daughter Oona, who dumped him for Charlie Chaplin to a lit-crit lesson on how Mark David Chapman could have possibly read Catcher as a manifesto urging him to kill John Lennon, this book says more than most about the world of writing, celebrity and American culture in the 20th century. <em>--Sara Nelson</em>David Shields is the author of fifteen books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Thing About Life Is That One Day You&#x2019;ll Be Dead</i>; <i>Reality Hunger</i>, named one of the best books of 2010 by more than thirty publications; and <i>Black Planet</i>, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. His work has been translated into twenty languages.<br><br>Shane Salerno is the director, producer, and writer of <i>Salinger</i>, which premiered theatrically in 2013 from the Weinstein Company and will debut as the 200th episode of <i>American Masters</i> on PBS in early 2014. In addition to <i>Salinger</i>, Salerno has written and produced a number of successful films and TV series.

Other works include Couriers, Demo, Local and Supermarket. He has earned multiple Eisner Award nominations, and his work has been published in close to a dozen foreign markets.A near-future America is torn by war between the Free Armies, who control New Jersey and the inland, and the United States, ensconced in New York City's boroughs. In the war-torn DMZ of Manhattan, Matty Roth, hired as a phototech intern to a famous battlefield journalist, is stranded when the rest of his crew is killed. Overcoming initial panic, he decides to remain as the sole embedded journalist in the devastated, largely depopulated city. It's a career-making assignment--if it doesn't get him killed. Befriended by former med student Zee, who runs a clinic, Matty discovers a society struggling to survive amid skirmishes and snipers (appropriate soundtrack music: Talking Heads' "Life during Wartime"). Of the <i>DMZ</i> issues<i> </i>collected here, the first three establish its premise. In the succeeding two, Matty discovers the "Ghosts of Central Park"--paramilitaries who defend the now-deforested preserve and its zoo animals--and chases a robber who steals his press badge. Wood's writing does justice to the intriguing concept, and Burchielli's jagged artwork effectively conveys the characters' desperation. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Mystery Guild Alt.</p><p>Dana Stabenow was born in Anchorage and raised on a 75-foot fish tender in the Gulf of Alaska. She knew there was a warmer, drier job out there somewhere and found it in writing. Her first crime fiction novel, A Cold Day for Murder, won an Edgar award. Her first thriller, Blindfold Game, hit the New York Times bestseller list.Fresh from killing and dressing a moose, subsistence fisher Kate Shugak (Play With Fire, 1995, etc.) allows her activist grandmother Ekaterina to drag her to big-city Anchorage before Ekaterina's Niniltna Native Association--in town for the annual Alaska Federation of Natives convention--votes whether a disputed parcel of tribal land be open to logging. Ekaterina, who's concerned that the protectionists' narrow majority on the Niniltna board has been disturbed by the death of Kate's cousin Sarah Kompkoff, would be frantic if she knew that the balance on the board is about to be altered further by a fatal accident. Meantime, Kate's lover and former colleague, Anchorage D.A.'s investigator Jack Morgan, is threatened with a custody suit by his bulldog ex. It's obvious from the beginning who's behind the Niniltna deaths, but you'll have a great time along the way to the arrest watching Kate, protesting vigorously, shop for evening wear at Nordstrom's (a cherishable scene), make an impromptu convention speech, break into a shady lawyer's office, sic her half-wolf dog on the bad guys, and plot a divinely effective revenge on the ex. Even though she says she hates the city, Kate glows throughout the case, presumably confident that her creator has framed the Anchorage background and the familiar issues perfectly.

Scientific research has finally discovered why most overweight people continue to gain weight despite the discomforts of demanding diets. Once the human body has been programmed to be fat, food restriction triggers a number of starvation defenses that protect the fat stores at the expense of other body tissues. Food calories that would normally provide energy are diverted into fat stores, leaving the dieter tired and hungry. Because food denial makes the body more energy efficient, lost weight is regained and maintained at even higher levels with less food. Diets, therefore, are doomed to failure. WHY REPROGRAMMING CAN WORK FOR YOU. Based upon this exciting scientific research, HOW TO LOWER YOUR FAT THERMOSTAT introduces an entirely new concept in weight management. By lowering that fat thermostat (setpoint) and changing the body&#39;s hormonal, enzymatic, and metabolic systems that normally protect fat stores, you will lose weight comfortably--without painful dieting. You&#39;ll feel better and enjoy higher energy levels. By treating the problem and not the symptom, you will lose the last pound as comfortably as the first while eating more food than you have been able to eat for years. Most important, this new book gives you a simple but scientific plan for lifelong weight control.</p><p></p><h2>Vocabulary From Classical Roots A: Teacher&#39;s Guide and Answer Key</h2><p>For use with the Level &#34;A&#34; textbook in this series.</p><p></p><h2>Before The Frost: A Linda Wallander Mystery (Kurt Wallander Mysteries (Hardcover))</h2><p>Taking a position with the Ystad police force shortly after graduating, Linda Wallander, the daughter of veteran inspector Kurt Wallender, struggles with their contentious relationship before becoming embroiled in the case of a childhood friend, who has inexplicably disappeared. By the author of The Return of the Dancing Master. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Internationally acclaimed author <b>Henning Mankell</b> has written thirty-three novels, including nine Kurt Wallander mysteries. Mankell divides his time between Sweden and Maputo, Mozambique, where he works as a director at Teatro Avenida.chapter 1<br><br> The wind picked up shortly after 9.00 on the evening of August 21, 2001. In a valley to the south of the Rommele Hills, small waves were rippling across the surface of Marebo Lake. The man waiting in the shadows beside the water stretched out his hand to discover the direction of the wind. Virtually due south, he found to his satisfaction. He had chosen the right spot to put out food to attract the creatures he would soon be sacrificing.<br><br> He sat on the rock where he had spread out a sweater against the chill. It was a new moon and no light penetrated the thick layer of clouds. Dark enough for catching eels. That's what my Swedish playmate used to say when I was growing up. The eels start their migration in August. That's when they bump into the fishermen's traps and wander the length of the trap. And then the trap slams shut.<br><br> His ears, always alert, picked up the sound of a car passing some distance away. Apart from that there was nothing. He took out his torch and directed the beam over the shoreline and water. He could tell that they were approaching. He spotted at least two white patches against the dark water. Soon there would be more.<br><br> He switched off the light and tested his mind--exactingly trained--by thinking of the time. Three minutes past nine, he thought. Then he raised his wrist and checked the display. Three minutes past nine--he was right, of course. In another 30 minutes it would all be over. He had learned that humans were not alone in their need for regularity. Wild creatures could even be taught to respect time. It had taken him three months of patience and deliberation to prepare for tonight's sacrifice. He had made himself their friend.<br><br> He switched on the torch again. There were more white patches, and they were coming nearer to the shore. Briefly he lit up the tempting meal of broken bread crusts that he had set out on the ground, as well as the two petrol containers. He switched off the light and waited.<br><br> When the time came, he did exactly as he had planned. The swans had reached the shore and were pecking at the pieces of bread he had put out for them, oblivious of his presence or by now simply used to him. He set the torch aside and put on his night-vision goggles. There were six swans, three couples. Two were lying down while the rest were cleaning their feathers or still searching for bread.<br><br> Now. He got up, took a can in each hand and splashed the swans with petrol. Before they had a chance to fly away, he spread what remained in each of the cans and set light to a clump of dried grass among the swans. The burning petrol caught one swan and then all of them. In their agony, their wings on fire, they tried to fly away over the lake, but one by one plunged into the water like fireballs. He tried to fix the sight and sound of them in his memory; both the burning, screeching birds in the air and the image of hissing, smoking wings as they crashed into the lake. Their dying screams sound like broken trumpets, he thought. That's how I will remember them.<br><br> The whole thing was over in less than a minute. He was very pleased. It had gone according to plan, an auspicious beginning for what was to come.<br><br> He tossed the petrol cans into the water, tucked his jumper into the backpack and shone the torch around the place to be sure he had left nothing behind. When he was convinced he had remembered everything, he took a mobile phone from his coat pocket. He had bought the phone in Copenhagen a few days before.<br><br> When someone answered, he asked to be connected to the police. The conversation was brief. Then he threw the phone into the lake, put on his backpack and walked away into the night.<br><br> The wind was blowing from the east now and was growing stronger.<br><br> chapter 2<br><br> It was the end of August and Linda Caroline Wallander wondered if there were any traits that she and her father had in common which yet remained to be discovered, even though she was almost 30 years old and ought to know who she was by this time. She had asked her father, had even tried to press him on it, but he seemed genuinely puzzled by her questions and brushed them aside, saying that she more resembled her grandfather. These "who-am-I-like?" conversations, as she called them, sometimes ended in fierce arguments. They kindled quickly, but they also died away almost at once. She forgot about most of them and supposed that he did too.<br><br> There had been one argument this summer which she had not been able to forget. It had been nothing really. They had been discussing their differing memories of a holiday they took to the island of Bornholm when she was little. For Linda there was more than this episode at stake; it was as if through reclaiming this memory she was on the verge of gaining access to a much larger part of her early life. She had been six, maybe seven years old, and both Mona and her father had been there. The idiotic argument had begun over whether or not it had been windy that day. Her father claimed she had been seasick and had thrown up all over his jacket, but Linda remembered the sea as blue and perfectly calm. They had only ever taken this one trip to Bornholm so it couldn't have been a case of their having mixed up several trips. Her mother had never liked boat journeys and her father was surprised she had agreed to this one holiday to Bornholm.<br><br> That evening, after the argument had ended, Linda had had trouble falling asleep. She was due to start working at the Ystad police station in two months. She had graduated from the police training college in Stockholm and would have much rather started working right away, but here she was with nothing to do all summer and her father couldn't keep her company since he had used up most of his holiday allowance in May. That was when he thought he had bought a house and would need extra time for moving. He had the house under contract. It was in Svarte, just south of the main road, right next to the sea. But the vendor changed her mind at the last minute. Perhaps because she couldn't stand the thought of entrusting her carefully tended roses and rhododendron bushes to a man who talked only about where he was going to put the kennel--when he finally bought a dog. She broke the contract and her father's agent suggested he ask for compensation, but he chose not to. The whole episode was already over in his mind.<br><br> He hunted for another house that cold and windy summer, but either they were too expensive or just not the house he had been dreaming of all those years in the flat on Mariagatan. He stayed on in the flat and asked himself if he was ever really going to move. When Linda graduated from the police training college, he drove up to Stockholm and helped her move her things to Ystad. She had arranged to rent a flat starting in September. Until then she could have her old room back.<br><br> They got on each other's nerves almost immediately. Linda was impatient to start working and accused her father of not pulling strings hard enough at the station to get her a temporary position. He said he had taken the matter up with Chief Lisa Holgersson. She would have welcomed the extra manpower, but there was nothing in the budget for additional staff. Linda would not be able to start until September 10, however much they might have wanted her to start sooner.<br><br> Linda spent the interval getting to know again two old school friends. One day she ran into Zeba, or "Zebra" as they used to call her. She had dyed her black hair red and also cut it short so Linda had not recognised her at first. Zeba's family came from Iran, and she and Linda had been in the same class until secondary school. When they bumped into each other on the street this July, Zeba had been pushing a toddler in a pushchair. They had gone to a caf� and had a coffee.<br><br> Zeba told her that she had trained as a barmaid, but her pregnancy had put a stop to her work plans. The father was Marcus. Linda remembered him, Marcus who loved exotic fruit and who had started his own plant nursery in Ystad at the age of 19. The relationship had soon ended, but the child remained a fact. Zeba and Linda chatted for a long time, until the toddler started screaming so loudly and insistently that they had to leave. But they had kept in touch since that chance meeting, and Linda noticed that she felt less impatient with the hiatus in her life whenever she managed to build these bridges between her present and the past that she had known in Ystad.<br><br> As she was going home to Mariagatan after her meeting with Zeba, it started to rain. She took cover in a shopping centre and--while she was waiting for the weather to clear up--she looked up Anna Westin's number in the directory. She felt a jolt inside when she found it. She and Anna had had no contact for ten years. The close friendship of their childhood had ended abruptly when they both fell in love with the same boy. Afterwards, when the feelings of infatuation were long gone, they had tried to resuscitate the friendship, but it had never been the same. Linda hadn't even thought much about Anna the last couple of years. But seeing Zeba again reminded her of her old friend and she was happy to discover that Anna still lived in Ystad.<br><br> Linda called her that evening and a few days later they met. Over the summer they would see each other several times a week, sometimes all three of them, but more often just Anna and Linda. Anna lived on her own as best as she could on her student budget. She was studying medicine.<br><br> Linda thought she was almost more shy now than when they were growing up. Anna's father had left home when she was five or six years old and they never once heard from him again. Anna's mother lived out in the country in L�derup, not far from where Linda's grandfather had lived and painted his favourite, unchanging motifs. Anna was apparently pleased that Linda had reestablished contact, but Linda soon realised that she had to tread carefully. There was something vulnerable, almost secretive about Anna and she would not let Linda come too close.<br><br> Still, being with her old friends helped to make Linda's summer go by, even though she was counting the days until she was allowed to pick up her uniform from fru Lundberg in the stockroom.<br><br> Her father worked flat out all summer, dealing with bank and post-office robberies in the Ystad area. From time to time Linda would hear about one case, which sounded like a series of well-planned attacks. Once her father had gone to bed, Linda would often sneak a look at his notebook and the case file he brought home. But whenever she asked him about the case directly he would avoid answering. She wasn't a police officer yet. Her questions would have to go unanswered until September.<br><br> The days went by. In the middle of one afternoon in August her father came home and said that the estate agent had called about a property near Mossbystrand. Would she like to come and see it with him? She called to postpone a rendezvous she had arranged with Zeba, then they got into her father's Peugeot and drove west. The sea was grey. Autumn was in the offing.<br><br> chapter 3<br><br> The windows were boarded up, one of the drainpipes stuck out at an angle from the gutter, and several roof shingles were missing. The house stood on a hill with a sweeping view of the ocean, but there was something bleak and dismal about it. This is not a place where my father could find peace, Linda thought. Here he'll be at the mercy of his inner demons. But what are they, anyway? She began to list the chief sources of concern in his life, ordering them in her mind: first there was loneliness, then the creeping tendency to obesity and the stiffness in his joints. And beyond these? She put the question aside for the moment and joined her father as he inspected the outside of the house. The wind blew slowly, almost thoughtfully, in some nearby beech trees. The sea lay far below them. Linda squinted and spotted a ship on the horizon.<br><br> Kurt Wallander looked at his daughter.<br><br> "You look like me when you squint like that," he said.<br><br> "Only then?"<br><br> They kept walking and behind the house came across the rotting skeleton of a leather sofa. A field vole jumped from the rusting springs. Wallander looked around and shook his head.<br><br> "Remind me why I want to move to the country."<br><br> "I have no idea. Why do you want to move to the country?"<br><br> "I've always dreamed of being able to roll out of bed and walk outside to take my morning piss, if you'll pardon my language."<br><br> She looked at him with amusement. "Is that it?"<br><br> "Do I need a better reason than that? Come on, let's go."<br><br> "Let's walk round the house one more time."<br><br> This time she looked more closely at the place, as if she were the prospective buyer and her father the agent. She sniffed around like an animal.<br><br> "How much?"<br><br> "Four hundred thousand."<br><br> She raised her eyebrows.<br><br> "That's what it says," he said.<br><br> "Do you have that much money?"<br><br> "No, but the bank has pre-approved my loan. I'm a trusted customer, a policeman who has always been as good as his word. I think I'm even disappointed I don't like this place. An abandoned house is as depressing as a lonely person."<br><br> They drove away. Linda read a sign by the side of the road: Mossbystrand. He glanced at her.<br><br> "Do you want to go there?"<br><br> "Yes. If you have time."<br><br> This was where she had first told him of her decision to become a police officer. She was done with her vague plan to refinish furniture or to work in the theatre, as well as with her backpacking trips around the world. It was a long time since she had broken up with her first love, a boy from Kenya who had studied medicine in Lund. He had finally gone back to Kenya and she had stayed put. Linda had looked to her mother, Mona, to provide her with clues about how to live her own life, but all she saw in her mother was a woman who left everything half done. Mona had wanted two children and had only had one. She had thought that Kurt Wallander would be the great and only passion of her life, but she had divorced him and married a golf-playing retired banker from Malm�.</p><h2>Chinese Herbology Made Easy</h2><p>'Chinese Herbology Made Easy' is used as a textbook at Yo San University of Traditional Chinese Medicine for its beginning herbology coursework.

After discovering at a very young age that she possessed certain psychic gifts and the ability to make contact with spirits of the dead, she developed an intense interest in the world of the occult. In the summer of 1969 she was formally introduced to witchcraft and spiritualism by an older family member, and has since devoted her personal life and writing career to educating the public about the ways of the Craft.<br>As a teenager, Gerina Dunwich (using a different nom de plume at the time) began writing poetry, short stories, magazine articles, and stage plays complete with musical scores. Her first published newspaper article,&nbsp;<i>His Voice was His Vehicle,</i>&nbsp;was an interview with singer/songwriter Jim Peterik from the rock n&#x2019; roll group, the Ides of March (and later, Survivor). Co-written with her cousin, Barbara Williams, it was published in October 1976.<br>By the spring of 1980 Gerina Dunwich was publishing a small press literary journal called&nbsp;<i>Golden Isis,</i>&nbsp;a one-woman operation that specialized in Goddess-inspired poetry and offbeat fiction. Its international circulation grew to nearly 3600 and it attracted subscribers from places as far away as Puerto Rico, Australia, Italy, and Japan.&nbsp;<i>Circle of Shadows</i>&nbsp;- a collection of Gerina&#x2019;s own poetry, was self-published a decade later.<br>After visiting Salem, Massachusetts, in April of 1984, Gerina relocated to the North Shore of Boston, residing first in Beverly, and then in Ipswich. In the winter of 1986, she purchased the historic Moses Day Homestead - a stately 17th century Colonial house in Haverhill that had been built around the time of the infamous Salem witchcraft trials. The house, which had been featured in a local television documentary about haunted houses in the Boston area, was a hotbed of paranormal activity. Soon after moving there, Gerina experienced a vivid dream in which the spirit of the late witchcraft author Sybil Leek appeared and whispered to her that her destiny as an author was "written in the stars." The dream proved to be prophetic when, in 1987, Gerina landed her first book contract with Citadel Press. (Appropriately, the contract was dated October 31st.) The following year saw the publication of her first book,&nbsp;<i>Candlelight Spells,</i>&nbsp;and the start of her successful career as a prolific book author.<br>In December of 1993 she moved into a century-old Victorian mansion located in the quaint and historic town of Fort Covington, New York. She soon opened a small shop on High Street called "The Country Witch" (later renamed "The Calico Cat Whatnot Shop"), which sold antiques, curios and various occult supplies. (Coincidentally, the antique shop run by Sybil Leek in the New Forest was also located on a High Street.) The business proved to be instrumental in bringing together many of the area's Pagans, including several who would later become Gerina's close friends and members of her coven.<br>In February of 1998 Gerina Dunwich received a ministerial license from the Universal Life Church. Ironically, the first handfasting she performed as a legally ordained minister was for the younger brother of the cousin who had introduced her to witchcraft nearly thirty years earlier.<br>Gerina has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows throughout the United States and Canada. She has lectured and presented workshops at festivals and gatherings across the country, including the CraftWise Pagan Gathering (Waterbury, Connecticut), the Real Witches' Ball (Columbus, Ohio), and Panpipes' Pagan Day Festival (West Hollywood, California).<br>She is a member of the International Ghost Hunters Society, the Author&#x2019;s Guild, and the Fellowship of Isis. Her biography is listed in a number of reference works, such as&nbsp;<i>Who's Who in the East; Who&#x2019;s Who of American Women, Personalities of America;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Crossroads: Who's Who of the Magickal Community</i>&nbsp;(published by The Witching Well Education and Research Center, 1988). She is also mentioned in Anne Carson's&nbsp;<i>Goddesses and Wise Women,</i>&nbsp;Raymond Buckland&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Witch Book,</i>&nbsp;and other works.<br>In addition to being an occult author and respected spokesperson for the Neo-Pagan community, Gerina Dunwich is a freelance paranormal researcher who specializes in ghost animals and animal-related hauntings. In 2005 she founded the Paranormal Animal Research Group, which investigates haunted places and researches animal sensitivity to paranormal anomalies.</p><h2>Serious Barbecue: Smoke, Char, Baste, and Brush Your Way to Great Outdoor Cooking</h2><p><strong>Adam Perry Lang trained with the world's best chefs before giving up four-star kitchens for the thrill of cooking with just meat and fire. Now he's on a mission to turn everyone into an expert.</strong><p>In <em>Serious Barbecue</em>, Adam Perry Lang has translated his intimate understanding of culinary technique into easy-to-follow advice to help a nation of backyard cooks unleash the raw power of one of the most flavor-packed cuisines around: American barbecue.</p><p>Perry Lang begins by breaking down the fundamentals of barbecue--what tools you'll need to begin, how to master cooking with charcoal and wood, how to choose the perfect grill, and more. Then he takes readers on a trip through the butcher's case, describing exactly what makes each kind of meat special, explaining how to select with the skill of a master, and providing his favorite recipes for almost every available cut of pork, beef, veal, lamb, chicken, and turkey.</p><p>These original, mouthwatering recipes, which include step-by-step seasoning instructions and a flip-by-flip grilling or smoking guide, will have amateur and expert cooks firing up their barbecues and enjoying perfect results every time--whether they're impressing a group of friends with Perry Lang's insanely delicious Salt and Pepper Dry-Aged Cowboy-Cut Rib Eye or wowing half the neighborhood with his massive, slow-cooking, succulent "Get a Book" Whole Pork Shoulder. Whatever the recipe, his goal is for everyone to achieve the holy grail of barbecuing: bragging rights.</p></p><p><p>A graduate with distinction of the Culinary Institute of America, <b>Adam Perry Lang </b>cut his teeth in New York at temples of haute cuisine Le Cirque and Daniel, and in Paris at the legendary Guy Savoy. But Daisy May's BBQ U.S.A. and his role as meat maestro at Mario Batali's Vegas Italian steakhouse, Carnevino, have propelled him into the national spotlight. He's currently working on a joint project with Jamie Oliver to bring his inimitable style to restaurants internationally. Perry Lang lives in New York City but travels the world preaching the barbecue gospel.</p>Lang is serious about being serious, and that starts with his credentials. His career began at Le Cirque; he then moved on to Daniel, Carnevino in Las Vegas, and a stint as a private chef. Along the way, he opened Daisy May's BBQ, one of Manhattan's best barbecue shacks. Thus, with four-star knowledge, he brings pork, beef, lamb and the lowly chicken to the open flame with a mix of science, anecdote and a wide array of seasonings. The chapter on pork begins not only with a look at the importance of fat but also the importance of collagen and the differences between commodity and heirloom pork. There's an interview with Dave Arnold of the French Culinary Institute that explores the relation between heat and meat and why foods stick to hot surfaces. His recipe for a marinated wet-aged rib eye explains that the wonders of Worcestershire sauce have to do with the flavor-enhancing qualities of anchovies and tamarind. Nearly every entry is composed of several brief preparation recipes, since each meat is uniquely paired with a seasoning combination for specific reasons. Before cooking the spit-roasted spring lamb, for instance, one must make a basting butter, seasoning blend, herb bundle and glaze. Even something that looks simple, like the delicious classic, burnt ends (a take on barbecued brisket), involves a mustard paste, a seasoning blend, a wrapping mixture and a finishing sauce.

Jung, Henry Corbin, and Adolf Portmann in the formulation of the field of Archetypal Psychology. This long-awaited amended third edition includes a complete checklist of Hillman&#39;s writings and a comprehensive bibliography of publications in the field.</p><p><p>The pioneering imaginative psychology of James Hillman that soon will span five decades has entered cultural history, affecting lives and minds in a wide range of fields. For the creativity of his thinking, the originator of Archetypal Psychology and author of A Terrible Love of War; The Soul's Code; and The Force of Character has received many honors, including the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. He has held distinguished lectureships at Yale, Princeton, Chicago, and Syracuse Universities, and his books have been translated into some twenty languages.

This volume recounts the years before Spence gained renown for the Karen Silkwood, Randy Weaver, and other trials. His father, who lived into his 90s, was a lifelong model of decency; Spence's deeply religious mother, however, placed a burden of guilt on the son by committing suicide during his rebellious youth. Like many an autobiographer, Spence finds his childhood more interesting than his readers will, but with adolescence the narrative takes off. That his prose is melodramatic merely seems fitting; Spence's worldview is melodramatic. After a few youthful adventures along brothel-and-merchant-marine lines, he returns to his native Wyoming. While still in college, he meets and marries his first wife. He finds law school easy but the first few years of practicing hard. It will come as a surprise to those familiar with Spence's current social views that he served two terms as a vice-busting county prosecutor and ran for Congress in 1962 as a right-wing Republican; his drubbing in that race turned him to despair, drink, and evidently his famous concern for the ``little guy.'' He recalls with pride his record of vastly increasing jury awards to plaintiffs, but describes with shame his inadequacies as husband and father during those years. In the end, he runs off with his second wife, stops drinking with help from Alcoholics Anonymous, and lives happily ever after, more or less. In an age of self-justification, Spence casts a relentlessly cold eye on his bad behavior as family man, lawyer, and sometime politician. Some readers should, however, find inspiration in Spence's ability to level with himself and still get over his self- loathing, and others will at least enjoy his story.

While much has been written on the Amish recently, little has appeared about their history. This book brings together for the first time in one volume a thorough history of the Amish people. From their beginnings in Europe through their settlement in North America, the Amish have struggled to maintain their beliefs and traditions in often hostile settings. Authoritative, thorough, and interestingly written, A History of the Amish presents the deep and rich heritage of the Amish people. Includes a substantial bibliography for further reading and study. Dozens of illustrations.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</p><p><br>Steven M. Nolt is associate professor of history at Goshen College where he teaches courses in American history and Mennonite history. Since 1999 he has worked with sociologist Thomas J. Meyers to document the history and contemporary life of Indiana&#x2019;s Old Order communities. During the 1990s he joined Donald B. Kraybill in charting the social and economic shifts among Pennsylvania Amish families moving from farming to non-farm occupations. Nolt graduated from Goshen College and also earned degrees at Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary (M.A.) and the University of Notre Dame (M.A., Ph.D.). His books include Foreigners in Their Own Land: Pennsylvania Germans in the Early Republic (Penn State, 2002) and co-authored volumes Through Fire and Water: An Overview of Mennonite History (Herald Press, 1996) and Amish Enterprise: From Plows to Profits (Johns Hopkins, 1995). A native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Steve is married to Rachel Miller of Engadine, Michigan. They are the parents of two daughters, Lydia and Esther.The author, currently a historical interpreter (i.e., a historian and a kind of tour guide) in the Amish country of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, successfully presents the entire history of the Amish since 1525 while avoiding both the overly sentimental approach of much popular writing and the anti-Amish bias of the rest. Nolt's emphasis on the role of "shunning" may strike some scholars as overly strong, but he is otherwise quite convincing. John Hostetler's Amish Roots ( LJ 11/1/89) provides a good selection of primary sources; Nolt puts these views in context, while including enough primary material to depict vividly the Amish way of life and beliefs. There are other more detailed and scholarly works about various aspects of the subject, but this is the only recent general history. It is marred, however, by a somewhat confusing organization and bland style. Nevertheless, in view of the general public's appalling lack of knowledge on the subject, this is an essential purchase.<br><i>- James H.

But suddenly their only hope for survival--never mind victory--was to unite to stop a mighty foe--one whose frightening technology appeared invincible. <br>Far worse beings than the Nazis were loose. From Warsaw to Moscow to China's enemy-occupied Forbidden City, the nations of the world had been forced into an uneasy alliance since humanity began its struggle against overwhelming odds. In Germany, where the banshee wail of hostile jets screamed across the land, caches of once-forbidden weapons were unearthed, and unthinkable tactics were employed against the enemy. Brilliantly innovative military strategists confronted challenges unprecedented in the history of warfare. <br>Even as lack of fuel forced people back to horse and carriage, physicists worked feverishly to create the first nuclear bombs--with horrifying results. City after city joined the atomic pyre as the planet erupted in fiery ruins. Yet the crisis continued--on land, sea, and in the air--as humanity writhed in global combat. The tactics of daredevil guerrillas everywhere became increasingly ingenious against a superior foe whose desperate retaliation would grow ever more fearsome.<br>No one had ever put the United States, or the world, in such deadly danger.

He has taught ancient and medieval history at UCLA, Cal State Fullerton, and Cal State L.A., and has published a translation of a ninth-century Byzantine chronicle, as well as several scholarly articles. <br><br>He is also a full-time science fiction and fantasy writer; much of his creative effort has been devoted to alternate history or history-based fantasy. His alternate history works include A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE (a first-contact story), THE GUNS OF THE SOUTH (a speculative novel of the Civil War), and the Worldwar tetralogy that began in 1994 with WORLDWAR: IN THE BALANCE. His novella "Down in the Bottomlands" won a Hugo award in 1994, and he is the coauthor, with actor Richard Dreyfuss, of THE TWO GEORGES. <br><br>Two of his fantasy series, The Videssos Cycle and The Tale of Krispos, are set in a world modeled on the Byzantine Empire, and he returns to that universe with his current Time of Troubles tetralogy. <br><br>He is married to fellow novelist Laura Frankos.

She cleverly showcases her characters, they come alive and you will be caught up in this novel&#x2019;s breathtaking suspense. This Novel embodies a philosophical essence of deep mysteries of love, identity, and art. It&#x2019;s a book you &#x201c;must share&#x201d; with your friends and family.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013:</strong> It's hard to articulate just how much--and why--<em>The Goldfinch</em> held such power for me as a reader.&nbsp; Always a sucker for a good boy-and-his-mom story, I probably was taken in at first by the cruelly beautiful passages in which 13-year-old Theo Decker tells of the accident that killed his beloved mother and set his fate. But even when the scene shifts--first Theo goes to live with his schoolmate&#x2019;s picture-perfect (except it isn&#x2019;t) family on Park Avenue, then to Las Vegas with his father and his trashy wife, then back to a New York antiques shop--I remained mesmerized. Along with Boris, Theo&#x2019;s Ukrainian high school sidekick, and Hobie, one of the most wonderfully eccentric characters in modern literature,&nbsp;Theo--strange, grieving, effete, alcoholic and often not close to honorable Theo--had taken root in my heart.&nbsp; Still, <em>The Goldfinch</em> is more than a 700-plus page turner about a tragic loss:&nbsp;it&#x2019;s also a globe-spanning mystery about a painting that has gone missing, an examination of friendship, and a rumination on the nature of art and appearances.&nbsp;Most of all, it is a sometimes operatic, often unnerving and always moving chronicle of a certain kind of life.&nbsp;&#x201c;Things would have turned out better if she had lived,&#x201d; Theo said of his mother, fourteen years after she died.&nbsp;An understatement if ever there was one, but one that makes the selfish reader cry out:&nbsp;Oh, but then we wouldn&#x2019;t have had this brilliant book! <em>--Sara Nelson</em>Donna Tartt was born in Greenwood, Mississippi, and is a graduate of Bennington College.

It seems that Mount Majestic, the rising and falling mountain in the center of the island, is not a mountain at all--it's the belly of a sleeping giant, moving as the giant breathes. Now Persimmony and her new friend Worvil the Worrier have to convince all the island's other quarreling inhabitants--including the silly Rumblebumps, the impeccably mannered Leafeaters, and the stubborn young king--that a giant is sleeping in their midst, and must not be woken.<br><br> Enhanced with Brett Helquist's dazzling illustrations, Jennifer Trafton's rollicking debut tells the story of one brave girl's efforts to make an entire island believe the impossible.</p><p>Jennifer Trafton lives in Franklin, Tennessee. This is her first novel.<br><br> Brett Helquist is the illustrator of <i>Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Persimmony Smudge, 10, is leading a life as dull as her name on the Island at the Center of Everything. But one day she goes out to find another magic pot (having broken the first one) and soon finds herself in the midst of a dangerous adventure. Twelve-year-old King Lucas, who loves pepper, disdains his subjects, and has a talent for rudeness, sends Persimmony, along with Worvil the Worrier and Guafnoggle the Jester, to see if there&#x2019;s really a sleeping giant under Mount Majestic and, if so, to make sure he is absolutely, positively not awakened. First-time novelist Trafton uses delicious descriptions and flight-of-fancy words to put Persimmony on the path of a hero&#x2019;s journey, and the story is filled with characters who make an impression. If the book gets a bit long in places, Helquist&#x2019;s pencil illustrations (though at times rather sketchlike) neatly break up the text. In this tale, which would lend itself well to reading aloud, Trafton offers a fresh take on a very familiar genre.

The stories jump back and forth in time and locale--Sedaris is in middle school, in college, in his grown, professional life; now North Carolina, now New York, now Normandy. The constant is Sedaris's narration, and that's why his delivery works so well with his words--every absurdity is made more believable (if not more palatable) thanks to his steady reading. He sounds incredulous and world-weary all at the same time. Death may be a recurring theme in these essays, but listeners will chuckle helplessly all the same.

When French paratroopers landed in the jungle on the border between Vietnam and Laos, the Vietnamese quickly isolated the French force and confronted them at their jungle base in a small place called Dien Bien Phu. The hunters-the French army-had become the hunted, desperately defending their out-gunned base. The siege in the jungle wore on as defeat loomed for the French. Eventually the French were depleted, demoralized, and destroyed. As they withdrew, the country was ominously divided at U.S. insistence, creating the short-lived Republic of South Vietnam for which 55,000 Americans would die in the next twenty years.</p><p><b>Martin Windrow</b> is an associate of the Royal Historical Society and a member of the Foreign Legion Association of Great Britain.

It is not often that the story of a struggle as dramatic as Dien Bien Phu is told with a flair that matches the courage of the adversaries and the sheer scale of the event. Martin Windrow's book is nothing less than a landmark in military history.' (Professor Richard Holmes ) 'This is an outstanding work of military history. It tells the story of the ghastly French experience in Indo-China in a way that has never been done before in English. The account of Dien Bien Phu is a masterpiece of meticulous historical narrative' (Max Hastings ) 'Success in battle, according to one military maxim, may not, on its own assure the achievement of national security goals, but defeat will guarantee failure. Mr Windrow's vivid and well-written account confirms that this was certainly not the case at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. His book is a tribute to his abilities both as a historian and a writer.' (THE ECONOMIST ) 'It is hard to praise to highly Martin Windrow's account, the first work of a historian who obviously possesses great gifts. It is surprising how many writers who describe battles lack any understanding of tactics and technology. Windrow is master of every detail... His book makes gripping reading. I hope he writes a lot more.' (Max Hastings THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH ) 'This anniversary reconstruction of France's most traumatic post-war battlefield defeat is highly opportune... Martin Windrow has pulled off a remarkable feat.' (SUNDAY TIMES ) 'Enthralling...Windrow gives a clear and cogent analysis of the general politico-military position, one that makes the fateful decision to invite a Viet Minh attack on Dien Bien Phu understandable... Anyone who found Stalingrad absorbing will find this book equally so. Like Beevor, Windrow gives one the very essence of battle... His character sketches of individuals from commanding officers down, are deft and accurate... This book is a wonderful account of a terrible battle...' (Alan Massie LITERARY REVIEW ) 'Martin Windrow's The Last Valley is the vividly told story of a miniature Stalingrad in which 10,000 French troops were besieged by a large army of Viet Minh for fifty-seven days, fifty years ago.' (HISTORY TODAY ) '...Dien Bien Phu, as Martin Windrow's moving and judicious account of the battle and of the two armies that fought it shows, was not at all a straightforward clash between the French and Vietnamese... Windrow tells it with great lucidity and humanity, with vivid portraits of the leading French officers, and... a very fair assessment of the internal dramas of Dien Bien Phu... he also offers asides on weaponry, battlefield medicine, morale... which are among the best elements of this good book.' (Martin Woollacott THE GUARDIAN ) 'Windrow has achieved a remarkable feat... The account is full of nice touches... A master of every detail, Windrow captures both the "prodigious human exertions" of the barefoot Viet Minh troops and the "courage and fighting skills" of the French legionnaires.' (THE WEEK ) --Professor Richard Holmes<br><br>Plenty of books have been written on Dien Bien Phu, but I think Martin Windrow's account of the battle is the best account of it yet. The French defeat in Vietnam is a classic example on how not to conduct a war. The French objective was to hang onto Indochina. But there never was any sufficient commitment to convincingly support this objective. The Vietnamese on the other hand had a very clear objective - getting rid of the invader - and whilst their tactics were not terribly sophisticated, they eventually carried that objective all the way to victory. Martin Windrow has written a meticulously researched book on the subject. He brings the human element to the foreground rather than getting lost in recounting logistics and detail of individual units. What particularly yelled out to me when I read the book was the suffering endured by both the French and the Vietnamese at Dien Bien Phu. If you are interested in the Vietnamese War then this is a must-read. --By Thomas Koetzsch</p><h2>Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p>Brand new condition hardcover book in its also mint condition decorative dustjacket.</p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of seventeen other Aunt Dimity mysteries.&nbsp; The first book in the series, <i>Aunt Dimity&#x2019;s Death</i>, was voted One of the Century&#x2019;s 100 Favorite Mysteries by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association.&nbsp; She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<p><b>One </b></p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard it said that when the poet T. S. Eliot was writing <i>The Wasteland</i>, he chose February as the cruelest month, then changed it to April in revisions. If you ask me, he got it right the first time. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, February&#x2019;s only redeeming feature is its brevity. If it were any longer, I would tear it from my calendar in protest.</p><p>Leap years? Don&#x2019;t talk to me about leap years. I suppose they serve a useful purpose, but if we must add an extra day to the calendar every now and again, why not add it to July? Or August? Or September? Why prolong the most miserable month of the year when we have so many pleasant months to choose from? Leap years, I&#x2019;m convinced, were invented solely to torment me.</p><p>January isn&#x2019;t so bad. January offers a pleasant return to routine after the hectic holiday season. The Christmas tree has been mulched or planted or turned into a bird feeder. The twinkly lights and the ornaments have been stored in the attic. The living room is spacious again, the dining room tidy, the kitchen organized. With the cessation of gift shopping, card writing, cookie baking, cr�che building, church decorating, and Nativity play rehearsing, time itself is uncluttered. Grown-ups are back at work, children are back in school, and life ticks along with the soothing regularity of a well-oiled grandfather clock.</p><p>By the first of February, however, the novelty of normalcy has worn off. Christmas is but a distant memory and spring isn&#x2019;t even a glimmer on the horizon. It seems as though it has always been and will always be winter&#x2014;bleak, cold, gray, dismal winter&#x2014;with no respite in sight. If one lived in New Zealand, one might regard the second month of the year as the jewel in summer&#x2019;s crown, but I lived in England and I regarded February as the lump of coal in my Christmas stocking.</p><p>It seemed churlish to grumble as yet another February hove into view because my life was in so many ways idyllic. I was married to a wonderful man, we had two beautiful children, and we lived in a honey-colored stone cottage in the Cotswolds, a rural region in England&#x2019;s West Midlands.</p><p>The nearest hub of civilization was Finch, a tiny village surrounded by rolling hills, patchwork fields, and not much else. Traffic jams were unknown in Finch, litter was seldom seen, and crime was virtually nonexistent. The villagers&#x2019; lives revolved around local events and a never ending stream of delicious gossip. A better woman might have turned a deaf ear to the tittle-tattle, but I wasn&#x2019;t a better woman. I believed quite strongly that inquisitive neighbors were preferable to indifferent ones and I behaved accordingly.</p><p>Though my husband and I were American, we&#x2019;d called England home for almost a decade and our nearly eight-year-old sons had never lived anywhere else. Bill ran the European branch of his family&#x2019;s venerable law firm from a building overlooking Finch&#x2019;s village green, Will and Rob attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping, and I scrambled to keep up with the myriad roles of wife, mother, community volunteer, busybody-in-training, and chairwoman of the Westwood Trust, a nonprofit organization that funded worthy projects.</p><p>Stanley, who lived with us in the cottage, did little but eat, sleep, frolic, and strike elegant poses, but since he had four paws and a tail, nothing more was expected of him. Stanley was a gleaming black cat with dandelion-yellow eyes and a dog-like devotion to Bill.</p><p>The rest of us were devoted to Bill&#x2019;s father, William Arthur Willis, Sr., a white-haired widower with a fondness for orchids, antiquarian books, and long walks in the countryside. Willis, Sr., was as wise as he was kind, an old-fashioned gentleman, and a doting grandfather. When he retired from his position as head of the family firm and moved into Fairworth House, a splendid Georgian mansion not far from the cottage, our family circle was complete.</p><p>With so many blessings raining down on my head, I had no right to whine about February, but when my husband was called away on the first of the month to attend to a client in Majorca, I couldn&#x2019;t help feeling hard done by.</p><p>I was, of course, accustomed to Bill&#x2019;s frequent business trips. He was an estate attorney with an international clientele and I couldn&#x2019;t blame him for doing his job. I could, however, blame him&#x2014;severely&#x2014;for basking in the sun on a flower-strewn Mediterranean island while I was cooped up in the cottage with a pair of bored and irritable little boys.</p><p>To be fair, Will and Rob were rarely bored or irritable. As identical twins, each had a built-in playmate, and as my offspring, they weren&#x2019;t lacking in imagination. Under normal circumstances, my sons were cheerful, energetic, and eminently capable of entertaining themselves. In winter, I could rely on them to spend their after-school hours in the meadow behind our back garden, sledding, throwing snowballs, and constructing everything from snow forts to snow dragons.</p><p>On Saturdays, I would drop them off next door at Anscombe Manor, where they would be free to pursue their primary passion: horseback riding. Nothing on earth, including my oatmeal cookies and Bill&#x2019;s imitation of a <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, pleased them more than a day spent galloping over hill and dale on their gray ponies, Thunder and Storm.</p><p>Sundays were spent first at church, then at Fairworth House, where Will and Rob had free rein to play hide-and-seek, explore the attics, and hone their shot-making skills at their grandfather&#x2019;s billiards table. If the spirit moved us, we&#x2019;d go on a family outing to a local attraction. All in all, my sons had little reason to complain that their lives were dull, dreary, and confined.</p><p>February&#x2019;s curse was upon us, however, and I could do nothing but stand by and watch as our pleasant routine disintegrated. Bill&#x2019;s departure coincided with a cold front that swept in from the North Sea, plunging our region into a deep freeze that proved to be too much for Morningside School&#x2019;s high-tech heating system. The school&#x2019;s headmistress telephoned me on Sunday evening to inform me that classes would be suspended for at least a week because the parts needed to repair the complex furnace were buried somewhere in a snow-covered warehouse in Helsinki.</p><p>Will and Rob liked school very much, but they were quick to see the advantages of an unscheduled vacation. Since dangerous wind chills prevented them from playing outdoors, they found new and creative ways to blow off steam. Overnight, every chair in the cottage became a trampoline, every table a launching pad, and every inch of floor space an obstacle course of train tracks, model cars, building blocks, dinosaurs, stuffed animals, and whatever else they could drag from their toy boxes and scatter underfoot. In self-defense, Stanley retreated to the guest room and hid under the bed, emerging only at night, when the boys were fast asleep and the coast was clear.</p><p>Unlike Stanley, I had nowhere to hide. On Wednesday, I imposed martial law, threatening my sons with dire consequences if they continued to behave like barbarians. They dutifully cleared the decks and settled down to more civilized pursuits, but drawing, reading, writing, and other forms of quiet play were poor substitutes for racing around the back meadow like a pair of untamed colts.</p><p>Unable to rid themselves of their pent-up energy, the twins&#x2019; tempers became frayed and their imaginations ran dry. When they weren&#x2019;t quarreling over crayons, books, board games, and toys, they were sitting morosely on the window seat in the living room, their identical noses pressed to the frigid panes, longing to be released from bondage. I was run ragged, trying to calm them down one minute and cheer them up the next.</p><p>I called Willis, Sr., for backup, but he&#x2019;d contracted a nasty head cold, and his housekeeper, a caring and capable young woman named Deirdre Donovan, had barred the door to visitors. When I heard his hoarse voice, I agreed that peace and quiet would be his best medicines and put away all thoughts of setting my sons loose at Fairworth House.</p><p>The germ afflicting Willis, Sr., had evidently spread far and wide because all of the boys&#x2019; school friends were sick as well. Though a few beleaguered mothers offered to offload their runny-nosed darlings on me, I was understandably reluctant to expose Will and Rob to such a virulent virus and gently refused to set up playdates.</p><p>As our options for escape narrowed, the cottage seemed to close in around us, becoming smaller and smaller with the passing of each spat-filled hour. During a brief moment of calm, I considered building a recreation center in the back meadow, equipped with a swimming pool, a cricket pitch, a riding ring, and miles of monkey bars. It seemed like a perfectly rational plan to me, but it also seemed likely that Bill would wish to have a say in it, so I shelved it for the moment and returned to the living room to keep peace among the pirates storming the sofa.</p><p>By Friday morning, the only weapon left in my maternal arsenal was the promise of spending Saturday at the stables. I unsheathed it during breakfast, reminding the boys that in less than twenty-four hours we would be on our way to the Anscombe Riding Center for a full day of horsey fun. Even if the cold snap prevented them from riding their ponies, I told them, they could spend the day cleaning tack, climbing hay bales, talking horse with their fellow equestrians, and grooming Thunder and Storm.</p><p>My pep talk worked like magic. Will and Rob bounced upstairs to play checkers in their room and I spent much of the morning singing, smiling, and baking cookies for them to share with their stable mates. I blithely disregarded February&#x2019;s malevolent influence until the telephone rang and I stiffened, gripped by a chilling sense of impending doom.</p><p>&#x201c;Lori?&#x201d; The voice on the other end of the line belonged to my best friend, Emma Harris, owner of the Anscombe Riding Center. &#x201c;I hate to say it&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I groaned inwardly and braced myself for bad news.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;but the stables will be closed for the foreseeable future,&#x201d; Emma continued.</p><p>&#x201c;Stables?&#x201d; I echoed weakly. &#x201c;Closed?&#x201d; I cast a haunted glance at the wall calendar, sank onto a kitchen chair, and put a weary hand to my forehead. &#x201c;How could you do this to me, Emma? Will and Rob have been bouncing off the walls <i>all week</i>. They <i>need</i> to see their ponies. Do you have the slightest inkling of what will happen when I tell them they <i>can&#x2019;t</i>?&#x201d; I covered my eyes and heaved a dolorous sigh. &#x201c;You have condemned me to a foreseeable future filled with terminal crankiness.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to inconvenience you, Lori,&#x201d; Emma said tartly, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re suffering a few inconveniences ourselves. The water pipes leading to the stables are frozen solid and one has burst. Derek and his crew are working on it, but at the moment, the stable yard is a skating rink.&#x201d;</p><p>Derek Harris was Emma&#x2019;s husband. Since he restored old buildings for a living, he had the tools, the skills, and the manpower needed to deal with just about any household emergency. If Derek couldn&#x2019;t repair or replace the damaged pipes quickly, no one could.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the curse,&#x201d; I muttered.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lori,&#x201d; Emma said impatiently. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going on about February again, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What month is it, my friend?&#x201d; I retorted. &#x201c;And what has happened to your pipes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pure coincidence,&#x201d; Emma replied. &#x201c;Cold spells happen in winter and pipes sometimes freeze during cold spells. It has nothing to do with a curse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the school&#x2019;s broken furnace and the universal head cold?&#x201d; I demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Coincidence,&#x201d; Emma said airily.</p><p>&#x201c;So you say,&#x201d; I grumbled, but even as I spoke it occurred to me that I might not be responding as a best friend should in a crisis. With a heroic effort, I thrust my own troubles aside and focused on Emma&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You poor thing. How can I help? Hot soup? Warm beds? A truckload of blowtorches? Name it and it shall be yours.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma chuckled. &#x201c;Thanks, Lori, but we&#x2019;re managing. It&#x2019;s a big job, though, and it&#x2019;ll take time to put everything back together again. The stables are high and dry, thank heavens, so we won&#x2019;t have to move the horses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are the horses okay?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re jittery because of the noise and the commotion,&#x201d; Emma replied, &#x201c;but they&#x2019;ll settle down once they get used to it. Tell Will and Rob not to worry about their ponies. We&#x2019;ll look after them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know you will, and so do the boys,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You must be up to your eyebrows in emergency management, Emma, so I&#x2019;ll let you go. If you need anything, day or night, you know who to call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have your number on speed dial,&#x201d; Emma assured me, and hung up.</p><p>I returned the receiver to its cradle and searched my mind for an alternate activity that would placate a pair of profoundly disappointed seven-year-olds, but for once my imagination failed me. I could think of absolutely nothing that would compensate Will and Rob for a Saturday devoid of horsiness. With my brain running on empty, I sat paralyzed at the kitchen table, unable to bring myself to break the disastrous news to my unsuspecting sons. I was still in a state of suspended animation when the doorbell rang.</p><p>I flew up the hallway to answer it, hoping to find a magician or an acrobat or a troupe of juggling chimpanzees on my doorstep, but what I found there was even more astonishing than a passing circus.</p><p>When I flung the front door open, I saw flames.</p></p><h2>Over and Over</h2><p>&#39;The year&#39;s seasonal changes and festivities that are important in a little child&#39;s life are imaginatively [described]. . . .

At such times, each man and woman must decide whether to hold on to the past, or to fight for the future.<br><br> In Midway Star System, President Iceni and General Drakon were building a future different from the oppressive and brutal rule of the Syndicate Worlds. Nearby star systems were choosing whether to align with Midway, risking devastation at the hands of vengeful Syndicate forces, or to cling to loyalty to the Syndicate, which had never worried about repaying loyalty in kind but had maintained stability for generations.<br><br> Taroa, Ulindi, Kane, and Kahiki had either joined with Midway or were seeking ties.<br><br> Iwa Star System, facing a threat much greater than anyone yet realized, would soon have to deal with the same decision.<br><br> �Who is in command of your ships?� the woman demanded, her image visible to Kapitan Kontos on the bridge of the battle cruiser Pele. She wore the suit of a Syndicate CEO, but some of the details of her clothing reflected sub-CEO status. Kontos wondered what had happened to the last CEO. Iwa hadn�t revolted against the Syndicate, but there were unmistakable signs that the Syndicate presence at lonely Iwa was as frayed as the cuff of the CEO�s suit.<br><br> "We have not received appropriate entry reports following your arrival," the woman said in tones not quite arrogant enough for an experienced CEO. "You are to explain your presence at Iwa and subordinate yourself to lawful Syndicate authority without delay. Forthepeople, Vasquez, out," she finished, running together the words of "for the people" in the usual Syndicate manner that reduced a supposed tribute to an empty string of sounds.<br><br> Kontos didn't have much experience with the diplomatic side of being a senior officer. Truth to tell, he didn't have much experience at all. Rebellion produced some amazing promotion opportunities. It also produced a lot of opportunities to be killed.<br><br> Still, despite his lack of experience, it wasn't hard for Kontos to understand why the authorities at Iwa Star System would be worried when a battle cruiser and a troop transport showed up from Midway. Midway was both a fairly well-off star system and the center of rebellion against the Syndicate in this region of space.<br><br> In contrast, Iwa was the sort of star system that was often summarized as "too much of nothing." A lot of asteroids and small barely-planets, a single gas giant that had nothing special about it, and beyond that several larger worlds that were simply giant balls of rock and ice. Only a single planet about nine light minutes from the star was marginally habitable, but too cold for human comfort, and its atmosphere contained too little oxygen while containing too many toxic compounds that would ravage human lungs. The Syndicate had nonetheless planted a colony there, the buildings and streets and factories mostly buried under the surface to allow easier heating. Iwa had once been a fallback position if Midway had fallen to the alien enigmas, with extensive fortifications and bases begun, then abandoned in various stages of completion as the Syndicate first diverted resources for the far-off war with the Alliance, and was later forced to refocus internally on its crumbling empire.<br><br> Kontos considered his reply for a few more moments. According to the rules by which the Syndicate worked, those in a position of strength were expected to lord it over individuals with weaker power bases, and those who were weaker were expected to bluff against their peers but to offer submission to the powerful. Every action was judged in terms of how it displayed strength or weakness, respect or insubordination.<br><br> The transmission from the Syndicate CEO had been sent just over three hours ago from the main inhabited world at Iwa. Kontos's reply would take another three hours to make its way back, because light only traveled at about eighteen million kilometers per minute, and there was still three light hours' distance between Pele and the planet where the Syndicate CEO resided. But by the rigid rules of Syndicate protocol, that CEO would be timing the reply to see how long Kontos took to transmit his answer. A subordinate was expected to reply within seconds. An equal could take a few minutes. A reply that was received in anything longer than six hours and a few minutes would be considered either a deliberate show of strength or a deliberate insult. <br><br> So Kapitan Kontos waited, purposely taking his time, while the specialists on the bridge of Pele pretended not to watch the clock and hid smiles at the way their Kapitan was disrespecting the Syndicate CEO. Kontos himself had little use for Syndicate CEOs. But the specialists, once all known as "workers" under the Syndicate system, tended to hate the CEOs who had been the highest level of official enforcing their subjugation to the Syndicate. Though "hate" was probably far too mild a word for the workers' feelings.<br><br> About ten minutes having elapsed since the receipt of the message, Kontos composed himself, trying to look every bit an officer of his rank and one who cared little for the expectations of a Syndicate CEO, then activated his reply. "This is Kapitan Kontos of the Free and Independent Midway Star System battle cruiser Pele. My ship is escorting troop transport HTTU 458, which is carrying ground forces and mobile forces personnel of the Syndicate Worlds who were captured by the forces of Midway at Ulindi Star System. In keeping with our agreement when they surrendered, our prisoners will be released to your custody. Do not bother claiming that you cannot take these people. We know that with the now-empty barracks that once held construction workers, the existing living facilities at Iwa are more than adequate to handle the additional Syndicate soldiers and crew members who are in the troop transport. Those personnel will require further transport to other locations in Syndicate space," he added, knowing how it would enrage the Syndicate CEO to be given a job to do by someone like Kontos.<br><br> "Once we have dropped off the Syndicate personnel," Kontos continued, "we will return to Midway. We have no hostile intent toward Iwa and will not launch any attacks while here. Unless we are first attacked, in which case we will reply with all the force of which this battle cruiser is capable. For the people, Kontos, out," he concluded, saying the last phrase with slow emphasis.<br><br> CEO Vasquez would not be happy with that reply, but unless she was a complete idiot she would limit her objections to bluster and legalisms. "Have we spotted any signs of possible hidden defenses?" Kontos asked.<br><br> "None, Kapitan," Pele's senior operations specialist replied. "The Syndicate records of the work being done here match what we can see, but most of that work is incomplete or clearly abandoned, showing no weaponry, no signs of human presence, and not even traces of power sources."<br><br> "Some defensive weaponry had been installed," Kontos said. "I saw those completed work orders in captured files."<br><br> "Yes, Kapitan. But those installations are now vacant. From what our sensors are showing, it looks like the Syndicate has been recently again cannibalizing Iwa for weapons, sensors, and anything else that is easily removed."<br><br> "It does," Kontos agreed. "Is this right? Communications we are intercepting within the star system indicate that only a single company of Syndicate ground forces remain?"<br><br> "Several messages that we intercepted reference that, Kapitan," the comm specialist replied, her voice confident. "There is only an Executive Third Class commanding them."<br><br> "An Executive Third Class?" Kontos questioned. "That is the senior Syndicate ground forces commander in Iwa at this time?"<br><br> "Yes, Kapitan."<br><br> It seemed impossible that even the Syndicate, overextended everywhere, would leave such a junior executive in command of the forces at Iwa. But, then, Iwa had little worth defending. "The Syndicate probably would have abandoned Iwa completely by now if Midway had not revolted," Kontos commented. "As it is, they are doing the minimum necessary to keep it as a potential staging ground for further attacks on us. Try to spot any indications that the Syndicate has shifted resources from here to Moorea. And try to pick up any comm chatter about the situation at Moorea and Palau. Anything about Syndicate activity, or other threats. President Iceni wants to know anything we can discover about the warlord or pirate who rumors say is operating in the region near Moorea Star System."<br><br> After that, it was only a matter of waiting as the battle cruiser and the troop transport crawled at point one five light speed toward the inhabited world. Forty-five thousand kilometers per second sounded fast on a planet, and was in fact impossibly fast in such a limited environment. But in space, where planets orbited millions and billions of kilometers apart, even such velocities took a while to cover distances too huge for human instincts to fully grasp. At point one five light speed, the three light hours that separated them from the inhabited world would take twenty hours to cover, but since the planet was itself moving through its orbit at about thirty-five kilometers per second, Pele and the troop transport had to aim to intercept the planet as it moved, their paths forming a huge arc through space.<br><br> "Kapitan," the comm specialist reported, "we have intercepted a system-wide message from CEO Vasquez ordering a safety stand-down by all Syndicate forces."<br><br> "That is certainly the safest course of action for them," Kontos agreed with a smile. Technically, CEO Vasquez was not surrendering to Kontos's demands. She could argue to her Syndicate superiors at Prime Star System that the safety stand-down had left her unable to fight. The senior CEOs at Prime probably wouldn't be impressed by that claim, but Vasquez was making the best of a situation with no good alternatives for her.<br><br> Pele and the transport were still a light hour away from the inhabited planet when an alert sounded. The tension level on the bridge immediately jumped as the warning of a warship was accompanied by a bright new warning marker on Pele's combat displays.<br><br> Kontos stared at his display, baffled, as the warning symbol appeared where no symbol should appear on the outskirts of this star system. The location was nearly five light hours distant, on the other side of Iwa Star System, so the unknown warship had appeared there five hours ago.<br><br> And then vanished as quickly as it had appeared.<br><br> "What was that?" Kontos demanded. "What kind of ship was that?"<br><br> Pele's sensors had automatically recorded everything that could be seen of the other ship in every frequency of the visual and electromagnetic spectrum, then compared that to the information in its databases. The answer to Kontos's question popped up on his display before he had finished asking the question. "An enigma ship?"<br><br> "Yes, Kapitan," the operations specialist replied, sounding worried. "One of their light combatants, about equal in size to our light cruisers."<br><br> "How could an enigma ship be at Iwa? The only jump point in a human-occupied star system that they can access in this region of space is at Midway. Iwa is too far from any enigma-controlled star system to be reached by them using jump drives. He must have been hiding from our sensors," Kontos concluded.<br><br> "Kapitan," the systems security specialist said, "we are scanning our sensor systems and all other ship systems now. No enigma-originated worms that could have hidden the presence of a ship have been found."<br><br> Kontos shook his head, glaring at his display. "You are saying that the ship was not there, then it was, then it wasn't? That could only mean it jumped into this star system, then jumped out again almost immediately."<br><br> "Yes, Kapitan," the systems security specialist agreed with clear reluctance.<br><br> "How is that possible?" Kontos demanded, turning to look at all of the specialists at their watch stations on the bridge. "There is no jump point at that spot in space."<br><br> "That location is nowhere near the jump points that Iwa has, Kapitan," the senior specialist said. "There are only two possibilities. Either the detection was a false one, something produced by a glitch in the sensor systems, or there is a jump point at that location that our own systems cannot identify."<br><br> Kontos frowned. "Is that possible? A jump point we cannot detect?"<br><br> The operations specialist hesitated. Not long ago, when still a worker under the Syndicate system, he would have done his best to avoid providing any useful answer, instead saying whatever he thought his superior wanted to hear. Workers learned the hard way that Syndicate superiors did not want to hear bad news or unexplained events.<br><br> But under Kommodor Marphissa, and now Kapitan Kontos, they had been encouraged to think and to give their best information. The specialist spoke slowly, choosing each word with care. "Kapitan, if the enigma warship did appear there, then we would have to conclude that it is possible for a jump point to be at that location, a jump point that we cannot detect with our sensors. But it is also possible that the warship was not really there, that the detection is a ghost generated by a flaw in the sensor systems which was quickly cleared."<br><br> Kontos nodded. "Run checks. Full diagnostics on everything. I don't see how this could be anything but the result of a glitch, but let's check it carefully."<br><br> "Incoming call from HTTU 458," the comm specialist reported.<br><br> The image of HTTU 458's commanding officer appeared before Kontos. "What was that?" she asked. "That ship that appeared on the edge of the star system?"<br><br> Kontos paused before answering. "Your ship saw it, too? Was it over the link with Pele?"<br><br> "No. My ship's sensors reported a detection independent of that from Pele. They identified what they called an enigma warship in the same location that Pele reported seeing one, then reported that the warship had vanished as if it had entered jump space." The transport's commanding officer shook her head. "But Iwa doesn't have a jump point there."<br><br> "No, it doesn't," Kontos said. "Or, rather, it's not supposed to have a jump point there. And we cannot see a jump point in that location."<br><br> "I know very little about the aliens, the enigmas. Can they do that?"<br><br> It was Kontos's turn to shake his head. "I don't know. Black Jack's people didn't tell us the enigmas could jump to places where we cannot see jump points, but they admitted they were able to learn little about the enigmas."</p><h2>Barbed Wire Baseball</h2><p>&nbsp;As a boy, Kenichi &#x201c;Zeni&#x201d; Zenimura dreams of playing professional baseball, but everyone tells him he is too small.

When the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor in 1941, Zeni and his family are sent to one of ten internment camps where more than 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry are imprisoned without trials.

This is her first children&#x2019;s book. She lives in New York City.Gr 3-5-Focusing on her subject's strength of character and love of baseball, Moss introduces readers to Kenichi Zenimura (1900-'68). At barely five feet tall, Zeni was hardly a natural athlete; nonetheless, he developed great prowess as a player and coach. Before World War II, he played exhibition games alongside Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and toured Japan, where he was born. His family moved to Hawaii when he was a child and later to Fresno, California. When war broke out, Zenimura, his wife, and teenage sons were sent to the Gila River internment camp in Arizona. In the barren desert environment, Zeni determined to build a baseball field and rallied others to his cause. Shimizu's artwork, created with Japanese calligraphy brush and ink on paper and Adobe Photoshop, depicts Zeni hoeing and pulling weeds in the hot sun. He made a field with real grass; a fence of castor beans; and, in an ironic twist, bleachers with wood scrounged from the barbed-wire fence posts surrounding the camp. In an afterword, Moss notes that Zenimura won posthumous induction into Japan's Shrine of the Eternals, the equivalent of baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Text and illustrations mesh to create an admiring portrait of an exemplary individual who rose above his challenges and inspired others. Pair this picture book with Ken Mochizuki's Baseball Saved Us (Lee &amp; Low, 1995) for an excellent read-aloud, or use it to introduce Kathryn Fitzmaurice's chapter book A Diamond in the Desert (Viking, 2012).

While our ancient ancestors had a legitimate use for the fight-or-flight instinct, today what was once a matter of survival has become the stuff of sleepless nights and anxiety-filled days. At its best, worry is a way for us to turn over and solve a problem in our minds. But for many, worry becomes a negative cycle of unnecessary suffering. Now, based on cutting-edge brain science, Dr. Martin Rossman has developed a program to help you break the worry cycle&#x2014;and transform worry into a positive force. <br><br>In <i>The Worry Solution</i>, Dr. Rossman gives you an easy-to-follow plan for taking control of your reactions to stress and anxiety. Using proven clinical techniques that harness the very power of imagination that creates worry and stress, you will learn the five basic skills that will help you to clarify your worries, sort them into those you can and cannot do something about, and tap the wisdom buried deep within you to help solve problems creatively. At the heart of the program is the use of guided imagery and creative visualization, techniques that invigorate the emotional and intuitive parts of the brain to add to and enhance logical intelligence. <br><br>Not only can you start to see a change in your stress levels immediately, but with regular practice, you may literally alter the worry pathways in your brain&#x2014;and "hardwire" yourself for calmness and clarity. Grounded in cutting-edge science and wonderfully accessible, <i>The Worry Solution</i> is a powerful and practical guide to living your best life&#x2014;healthier, happier, and free from unnecessary stress.</p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Author Martin Rossman, M.D.</b> <br> <p></p> <b>Is worry always bad for you?</b><br> No, that&#x2019;s the point of <i>The Worry Solution</i>. &#x201c;Good&#x201d; worry can help you solve problems and avoid danger. It&#x2019;s just when you let it become a bad habit that it becomes a problem. <p></p> <b>Do women worry more than men? If so, why?</b><br> All studies show that women worry more than men. Why? Probably because they have more to worry about&#x2014;including men! Biologically speaking, with women generally being smaller, slower, and physically weaker than men, it makes sense for them to be more vigilant and careful, especially to signs of violence and aggression. Brain studies show that the areas in the brain that process fear and vigilance are considerably larger in women, and I have to assume that was in the survival interest for them and their young. Now, with so much frightening information coming to us through the media, everyone, women especially, need to upgrade their mental software so as to be able to focus on using worry well. <p></p> <b>How can we develop a good worry habit if we are living with very real worries&#x2014;like facing eviction or not having health care, or having family in a war-torn country?</b><br> Unfortunately, <i>The Worry Solution</i> cannot remove real tragedy and hardship from life. But it can eliminate a great deal of tragedy and hardship that never actually happens. The essence of <i>The Worry Solution</i> is separating things into those you can do something about from those you can&#x2019;t, and learning how to deal better with both. It doesn&#x2019;t mean life is easy, but it can help us avoid making life harder than it needs to be. <p></p> <b>Can you explain why guided imagery is so effective in reducing worry and anxiety? </b><br> Imagery-based thinking shifts our attention out of the ruts of worry we may have inadvertently created and immediately shows us that we can have choices about what we experience. It is also the most direct and potent way to connect with our ability to relax, access our own wisdom, and solve problems creatively. Imagery can transform worry from a bad habit to a powerful tool for living. <p></p> <b>Using the techniques outlined in this book, how soon would someone see a difference in their worrying habits? </b><br> If people haven&#x2019;t ever experienced a way to consciously relax their bodies and minds, they often feel better immediately after doing that! Just knowing that whether you are consumed by worry or have other options is very freeing and changes the way people think. To change a habit, though, takes practice and repetition. Someone with a bad worry habit might need three to six weeks to develop a better way to use their ability to worry. <p></p> <b>How do people know when they need medication for their worry and when they can use guided imagery alone?</b><br> There are traumatic times when fear goes beyond worry and it can take over our minds&#x2014;creating panic and high levels of anxiety. When the brain is aroused that way, it may take medications to get the anxiety level down to where people can regain control of their faculties. <p></p> But when the worry is chronic and habitual, it is wise to learn the skills taught in <i>The Worry Solution</i> and see what they can do for you. Many people find that gets them back in control of themselves and they don&#x2019;t need medications. <p></p>MARTIN ROSSMAN, M.D., a pioneer in mind/body medicine, is a clinical instructor at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical School and the founder of www.thehealingmind.org.

They visit Steeple Bumpleigh, home of Bertie's Uncle Percy, also the home of Bertie's ex-fianc�e, Florence, and her new fianc�, Constable Stilton Cheesewright. In addition, Bertie's cousin, Nobby, wants Bertie's help in gaining Uncle Percy's approval of her writer fianc�. To complicate the romantic antics, Stilton thinks Bertie wants to reconcile with Florence (as does Florence) and threatens bodily harm. Into the muddle comes Jeeves, who, as always, saves the day.

This breathtaking sequel to Pullman's highly acclaimed The Golden Compass will leave readers eager for the third and final volume of His Dark Materials.<br><br>Honors and Awards for The Subtle Knife:<br><br>An ALA Best Book for Young Adults<br>A Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year<br>A Horn Book Fanfare Honor Book<br>A Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books Blue Ribbon Book<br>A Book Links Best Book of the Year<br>A Parents' Choice Gold Book Award<br>An American Bookseller "Pick of the Lists"</p><p>With <i>The Golden Compass</i> Philip Pullman garnered every accolade under the sun. Critics lobbed around such superlatives as "elegant," "awe-inspiring," "grand," and "glittering," and used "magnificent" with gay abandon. Each reader had a favorite chapter--or, more likely, several--from the opening tour de force to Lyra's close call at Bolvangar to the great armored-bear battle. And Pullman was no less profligate when it came to intellectual firepower or singular characters. The d�mons alone grant him a place in world literature. Could the second installment of his trilogy keep up this pitch, or had his heroine and her too, too sullied parents consumed him? And what of the belief system that pervaded his alternate universe, not to mention the mystery of Dust? More revelations and an equal number of wonders and new players were definitely in order.<p> <i>The Subtle Knife</i> offers everything we could have wished for, and more. For a start, there's a young hero--from our world--who is a match for Lyra Silvertongue and whose destiny is every bit as shattering. Like Lyra, Will Parry has spent his childhood playing games. Unlike hers, though, his have been deadly serious. This 12-year-old long ago learned the art of invisibility: if he could erase himself, no one would discover his mother's increasing instability and separate them. </p><p> As the novel opens, Will's enemies will do anything for information about his missing father, a soldier and Arctic explorer who has been very much airbrushed from the official picture. Now Will must get his mother into safe seclusion and make his way toward Oxford, which may hold the key to John Parry's disappearance. But en route and on the lam from both the police and his family's tormentors, he comes upon a cat with more than a mouse on her mind: "She reached out a paw to pat something in the air in front of her, something quite invisible to Will." What seems to him a patch of everyday Oxford conceals far more: "The cat stepped forward and vanished." Will, too, scrambles through and into another oddly deserted landscape--one in which children rule and adults (and felines) are very much at risk. Here in this deathly silent city by the sea, he will soon have a dustup with a fierce, flinty little girl: "Her expression was a mixture of the very young--when she first tasted the cola--and a kind of deep, sad wariness." Soon Will and Lyra (and, of course, her d�mon, Pantalaimon) uneasily embark on a great adventure and head into greater tragedy.</p><p> As Pullman moves between his young warriors and the witch Serafina Pekkala, the magnetic, ever-manipulative Mrs. Coulter, and Lee Scoresby and his hare d�mon, Hester, there are clear signs of approaching war and earthly chaos. There are new faces as well. The author introduces Oxford dark-matter researcher Mary Malone; the Latvian witch queen Ruta Skadi, who "had trafficked with spirits, and it showed"; Stanislaus Grumman, a shaman in search of a weapon crucial to the cause of Lord Asriel, Lyra's father; and a serpentine old man whom Lyra and Pan can't quite place. Also on hand are the Specters, beings that make cliff-ghasts look like rank amateurs. </p><p> Throughout, Pullman is in absolute control of his several worlds, his plot and pace equal to his inspiration. Any number of astonishing scenes--small- and large-scale--will have readers on edge, and many are cause for tears. "You think things have to be <i>possible</i>," Will demands. "Things have to be <i>true</i>!" It is Philip Pullman's gift to turn what quotidian minds would term the impossible into a reality that is both heartbreaking and beautiful. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"JUST AS QUICK-MOVING AND UNPUTDOWNABLE AS [THE GOLDEN COMPASS] . . .

She lives in Bristol.Real estate trumps true love in this often hilarious, British black comedy of manners and property values. After the second-story balcony of London lawyer Michael's townhouse crashes at his feet, nearly killing him, he decides to take a holiday to sort out his unhappy life. His wife, Rebecca, miserable with motherhood and marriage, is glad to see him and their introverted three-year-old, Hamish, hie off to the fine old country farm of Michael's university friend Adam Hansbury. But all is not well at Egypt, the oddly named Hansbury estate. Patriarch Paul is hospitalized, but no one visits him; his audacious ex-wife (Adam's mother) remains a frequent "guest" at her former home, where Paul's current wife doles out money, food and complaint to the malcontent step- and grandchildren who come and go. Even Adam is acting strangely. As the discord among the Hansburys escalates to violence and revenge, Michael becomes privy to a secret that unites the family where love and filial piety failed. Whitbread-winner Cusk (<i>The Country Life</i>, etc.) serves up crisp prose full of the unexpected pleasures of observation and metaphor, but this is a book about clever people behaving venally, and as such, the only person to really root for is poor silent Hamish. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Stealing the bodies of the living, they are grouping together into powerful consortiums led by leaders from history. An increasingly desperate Confederation Navy is struggling to stem the tide as the race for the universe&#39;s most powerful weapon begins. But if the dead can return to life, who will be the ultimate victors?</p><p><i>The Neutronium Alchemist: Conflict</i>, is the second part of the second novel of Peter F. Hamilton's space opera epic that ranges not only across interstellar space but across the boundary between life and death. (The series begins with <i>The Reality Dysfunction:</i> <i>Emergence</i> and <i>Expansion</i>). This book mainly revolves around Dr. Alkad Mzu, creator of a doomsday weapon so powerful it scares even the citizens of this high-tech and heavily beweaponed future. Mzu is on a decades-long quest to take vengeance against the people who destroyed her home planet, and she wields alarming cunning and ruthlessness in the pursuit. But what gives even her pause is the war against the souls of the dead who have returned from a hellish Beyond to possess the living. Both sides want her: the dead want the weapon, the living want to keep the weapon out of the dead's hands. Unfortunately for them, that means they must find and take Mzu alive, while all the dead need to do is kill her, bringing her into their realm.<p> Rarely has science fiction produced a series as rich, satisfying, and <i>big</i> as this one.

The traditional therapeutic model sets its sights on the past, but Phil Stutz and Barry Michels employ an arsenal of techniques&#x2014;&#x201c;the tools&#x201d;&#x2014;that allow patients to use their problems as levers that access the power of the unconscious and propel them into action. Suddenly, through this transformative approach, obstacles become opportunities&#x2014;to find courage, embrace discipline, develop self-expression, deepen creativity. <br>&nbsp;<br>For years, Stutz and Michels taught these techniques to an exclusive patient base, but with <i>The Tools,</i> their revolutionary, empowering practice becomes available to every reader interested in realizing the full range of their potential. The authors&#x2019; goal is nothing less than for your life to become exceptional&#x2014;exceptional in its resiliency, in its experience of real happiness, and in its understanding of the human spirit.<br><br><b>&#x201c;An &#x2018;open secret&#x2019; in Hollywood . . . [Stutz and Michels] have developed a program designed to access the creative power of the unconscious.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p><strong>A Letter from the Authors: What Is a Tool?</strong> <br> In conventional psychotherapy, we talk about &#x201c;insights&#x201d; or &#x201c;causation&#x201d; and we tend to believe that if we can uncover the deep-seated reasons behind someone&#x2019;s problems, then the person will change automatically. This implies that awareness alone creates the forces that cause change. But real change, the kind of change patients in therapy cry out for, means changing your behavior, not just your attitude. <p>That requires much stronger forces. A tool is a technique or procedure that can generate a force that allows you to do the work of change. It is work that must be done in real time. When do we use a tool? In the present.</p> <p>Conventional therapy tends to be passive and focuses on the past. It excavates a patient&#x2019;s history, usually from childhood, brings it into the light of day and interprets it so as to strip it of its unconscious power. I have the greatest respect for the past. Memories, emotions, insights can all be very valuable. But my patients needed help and relief in the present and all the insights in the world weren&#x2019;t going to be powerful enough to deliver that.</p> <p>To control your actions you need something else: a specific procedure you can use systematically to combat a specific problem -- you need a tool.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s an obvious objection that arises here: Isn&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;re doing superficial? Sure, these tools of yours may help a patient change his or her behavior but you haven&#x2019;t addressed the underlying reasons. Unless you do that they&#x2019;re bound to go back to their (self-) destructive ways sooner or later.</p> <p>There are two answers to this objection. The first involves a misunderstanding of how people change. Insight into the &#x201c;reasons&#x201d; for a problem isn&#x2019;t the cause of change &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the result. Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous have always known this. You don&#x2019;t join AA and then sit around discussing why you drink too much over a few beers or vodka martinis. You join to stop drinking one day at a time. Only after that can you look into the roots of your addiction by &#x201c;taking inventory.&#x201d;</p> <p>The second answer goes back to our original question about what a tool is. There has been a bias in psychotherapy implying that anything that is active and involves your will is superficial; as if the deepest part of human experience can only occur inside your head. The truth is the opposite; the deepest part of human experience happens when you interact with the world outside yourself. That means you need to go beyond thinking and into &#x201c;doing&#x201d;&#x2014;and this is exactly what a tool makes possible.</p> <p></p><b>Phil Stutz</b> graduated from City College in New York and received his MD from New York University.

In 1919, Beach opened her own English-language bookshop and lending library, Shakespeare and Company, which would become the cynosure of an entire literary movement. Literary expatriates were drawn to her shop, and Ernest Hemingway declared of Sylvia, "No one that I ever knew was nicer to me." But her most celebrated literary efforts are those she made on behalf of her literary idol, James Joyce, undertaking the publication of <i>Ulysses</i>. Noel Riley Fitch uses Beach as the focal point for a fascinating portrait of an artistic community filled with anecdote after anecdote. From the intellectual salons at Natalie Barney's residence--of which "William Carlos Williams would recall only the lesbian women dancing together"--to the seemingly constant presence of Ezra Pound, Fitch's account solidifies the importance of the time and place he so vividly re-creates. <i>--Ron Hogan</i>The story of Sylvia Beach&#39;s love for Shakespeare and Company supplies the lifeblood of this book. &#39;An absorbing book, backed by an impressive amount of research.

In his newest book he directs our attention to the psychology of our culture by providing a distinctly American portrait of the place--and displacements--of myth in our society. As is customary for this author, the text weaves case studies and considerable literary exegesis into his cogent analyses. May demonstrates his thesis--that "Each myth in human history is interpreted according to the needs of the society which it reflects"--and keeps good his promise to provide an American audience currently interested in the mythic realms of other cultures (witness the popularity of Joseph Campbell's works) with insight on our own mythology.

This chronology of writings from Baudelaire to Baudrillard traces how artists have affirmed color as a space of pure sensation, embraced it as a tool of revolution or denounced it as decorative and even decadent. It establishes color as a central theme in the story of modern and contemporary art and provides a fascinating handbook to the definitions and debates around its history, meaning, and use.Artists surveyed include: Joseph Albers, Mel Bochner, Daniel Buren, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, Jimmie Durham, Helen Frankenthaler, Paul Gauguin, Donald Judd, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Yves Klein, Kazimir Malevich, Piero Manzoni, Henri Matisse, Henri Michaux, Beatriz Milhazes, Piet Mondrian, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, H�lio Oiticica, Paul Signac, Ad Reinhardt, Gerhard Richter, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Bridget Riley, Mark Rothko, Yinka Shonibare, Jessica Stockholder, Theo van Doesburg, Vincent van Gogh, Victor Vasarely, Rachel Whiteread.Writers include: Theodor Adorno, Roland Barthes, Charles Baudelaire, Jean Baudrillard, Walter Benjamin, Charles Blanc, Jacques Derrida, Thierry de Duve, Umberto Eco, Victoria Finlay, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Johannes Itten, Julia Kristeva, Claude L�vi-Strauss, Jacqueline Lichtenstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, John Ruskin, Adrian Stokes, Ludwig Wittgenstein</p></p><p>David Batchelor is a London-based artist and writer who has exhibited widely in Britain, continental Europe, the United States and Latin America. A regular contributor to journals such as Artforum and frieze, he is the author of Minimalism (Tate Publishing, 1997) and Chromophobia (Reaktion, 2000). He is Senior Tutor in Critical Art Theory, Department of Curating Contemporary Art, Royal College of Art, London.&#34;In this remarkably imaginative collection of texts and fragments, David Batchelor has mined modern culture to extract deep seams of colour-thought. Like any great collection of things, it draws together the widest range of sources - from Melville to Matisse to Wittgenstein to Johnny Cash - to completely transform the way we think about how colour works in art and beyond.&#34; - Briony Fer, Professor of History of Art, University College London</p><h2>South from Granada (Kodansha Globe)</h2><p>The author shares his impressions of the people and culture of Yegen, a small village in the South of Spain</p><p>Gerald Brenan (1894-1987) was an English writer who spent much of his life in Spain. He is best known for The Spanish Labyrinth, a work of history on the background to the Spanish Civil War and for South From Granada: Seven Years in an Andalusian Village. He was awarded a CBE in 1982, and was much honoured in Spain. Chris Stewart is the author of Driving Over Lemons, which told the story of how Chris set up home in Spain to farm sheep and oranges and it went on to become an international best-seller. The &#39;sort-of&#39; sequel A Parrot In The Pepper Tree followed in 2002 and continued the success of the first book. 2006 saw the publication of Chris&#39; third book The Almond Blossom Society.</p><h2>The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World</h2><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER<br><br>Two great spiritual masters share their own hard-won wisdom about living with joy even in the face of adversity.</b><br>The occasion was a big birthday. And it inspired two close friends to get together for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet, despite having experienced great personal and national suffering.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake, the first being their personal stories and teachings about joy. Both the Dalai Lama and Tutu have been tested by extraordinary adversity, oppression, and conflict. The second layer consists of the exciting research into joy as well as the other qualities essential for any enduring happiness, like gratitude, humility, humour, compassion, generosity, and forgiveness. And the third encompasses practical exercises and guidance based on the Dalai Lama's and Tutu's own daily practices, which anchor their emotional and spiritual lives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and even wise-cracking humour, how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of being.</p><p>HIS HOLINESS THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA, TENZIN GYATSO, was born in 1935 to a peasant family in northeastern Tibet and was recognized at the age of two as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. The world's foremost Buddhist leader, he travels extensively, speaking eloquently in favor of ecumenical understanding, kindness and compassion, respect for the environment, and, above all, world peace.<br><br>DESMOND TUTU won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 and was only the second black person ever to receive it. In 1986 he was elected archbishop of Cape Town, the highest position in the Anglican Church in South Africa. In 1994, after the end of apartheid and the election of Nelson Mandela, Tutu was appointed as chair of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate apartheid-era crimes. His policy of forgiveness and reconciliation has become an international example of conflict resolution, and a trusted method of postconflict reconstruction. <br><br>DOUGLAS CARLTON ABRAMS is a former editor at the University of California Press and HarperSanFrancisco. He is the co-author of a number of books on love, sexuality, and spirituality, including books written with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar, and Taoist Master Mantak Chia.<b>A&nbsp;<i>Globe and Mail</i>&nbsp;Self-Improvement Bestseller</b><br><b><i><br></i>A&nbsp;<i>Toronto Star</i>&nbsp;Self-Improvement Bestseller</b></p><h2>Dark Nights: Metal: Dark Knights Rising</h2><p><b>Seven nightmarish versions of Batman from seven dying alternate realities have been recruited by the dark god Barbatos to terrorize the World's Greatest Heroes in our universe.

He died in a private-plane crash in 1970. Graham ( Cowboys and Cadillacs ) describes Murphy's wartime exploits and film career in engrossing detail and keeps a probing eye on his subject's character, personality and behavior, building a convincing case that Murphy was a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder. In his postwar years, the actor was a twice-married womanizer who gambled away an estimated $3 million, served as an auxiliary crime-fighter for various police departments while consorting with gangsters, devoted himself to concocting crude practical jokes and regularly threatened to kill anyone who crossed him. (Two years before his death he was tried and acquitted of attempted murder.) Aside from his awesome war record and struggle to improve his shaky acting skills, there seems little about Murphy to admire, but Graham, history professor at the Univ. of Texas, paints a portrait of a man more to be pitied than scorned. The book is the well-told tale of a lost soul who lived an extraordinary life. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Graham brings two advantages to his biography of war hero/movie star Murphy: like Murphy he was raised in rural Texas; and as a professor of English, Graham is capable of composing a literate sentence. Murphy, America's most decorated soldier in World War II, went on to become a top movie draw in the 1950s via a series of low-budget Westerns. As Graham shows, Murphy suffered acutely from post-combat stress syndrome, and until his death in a plane crash in 1971, Murphy's life was an unhappy one. No Name on the Bullet does a good job of covering both Murphy's military and film careers, and it is a biography well above the average.<br><i>- John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

But in order to make the shades they had imagined, people had to unearth pigments and dyes often hidden deep within plants, minerals, mollusks, insects, and other natural elements. They developed complicated, dangerous, and sometimes even revolting techniques in order to achieve deep reds, luminous yellows, and the most beautiful blues. <br><br>Archaeologist and ethnologist Anne Varichon takes the reader on a fascinating journey that examines not only the variety and use of natural colorants&#x2014;and how to reproduce them today&#x2014;but also their symbolism and mythology.

Overseas, we were embroiled in a war we couldn't win; at home our streets had become battlefields; and in Washington, the old liberal order was collapsing under the weight of a long string of failed policies. "It seemed that an era of American optimism and progress had come to a close," Hayward writes. "The concatenation of Vietnam, Watergate, the recurrent energy crisis, the swooning economy, the increasingly disorderly world scene, and the failed presidencies associated with these events robbed Americans of their native optimism for the future."<br>Meanwhile, from out of the West arose a new conservative movement led by Ronald Reagan, a one-time Hollywood actor whose speech in 1964 in support of the doomed candidacy of Barry Goldwater not only electrified a national television audience but also created a political star who would change the course of history.<br>With meticulous detail, Hayward captures an America at war with itself&#x2014;and an era whose reverberations we feel to this very day. He brings new insight into the profound failure of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the oddly liberal nature of Richard Nixon's administration, the significance of Reagan's years as California's governor, and the sudden-death drama of his near defeat of Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primary, the listlessness of Jimmy Carter's leadership, and the political earthquake that was Reagan's victorious presidential campaign in 1980.<br>Provocative, authoritative, and majestic in scope, <i>The Age of Reagan</i> is an unforgettable account of the rebirth and triumph of the American spirit.</p><p>"Readers both conservative and liberal can learn much about our times and our leaders from this work."&#x2014;<b>Michael Barone,</b> <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i><br>"A patient and comprehensive account of domestic and foreign policy development is wonderfully useful, and we have Steven Hayward to thank for casting light on Reagan, who arrived at the White House in 1981 with a purposeful gleam in his eye recalling Lenin arriving at the Finland Station."&#x2014;<b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b><br>"Steven Hayward has given us a fascinating and extremely readable book about a unique era in american politics.

MODESITT, JR. is the bestselling author of more than seventy novels encompassing two science fiction series, the Ghost Books and the Ecolitan Matter, and four fantasy series, the Imager Portfolio, the Saga of Recluce, the Spellsong Cycle and the Corean Chronicles. He lives in Cedar City, Utah.<b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Quaeryt peered out from underneath the thick&#x2014;and warm&#x2014;comforter toward the nearest bedchamber window, its inner shutters fastened tightly. Even so, he could see frost on parts of the polished goldenwood. Supposedly, winter was waning, with spring some three weeks away, except that winter lasted into spring in Tilbor, even in Tilbora, the southernmost city in the province. The harbor in far-north Noira would not ice-out until the end of Maris, most likely.<br>A lithe figure wrapped her arms around him. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to get up yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do. It&#x2019;s Lundi, and I am princeps, you might recall...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dearest&nbsp;... do you have to?&#x201d; The excessively pleading tone told Quaeryt that Vaelora knew he needed to rise, but that&nbsp;...<br>He turned over and embraced her wholeheartedly, finding her lips on his.<br>All too soon, he released her, wishing that he did not have to leave their bed. But then, it had been her desire to remind him of that.<br>Bhayar had been right. Quaeryt and Vaelora were enjoying being married, even if he&#x2019;d never seen it coming. Vaelora had protested that she hadn&#x2019;t either, that her brother had insisted she join him on his ride to Tilbora to keep her from the trouble she might have gotten into in his absence. Quaeryt had his doubts about her purported ignorance, but if that was the way she wished to portray matters, he&#x2019;d certainly respect it. Then&nbsp;... it could have been that way. She hadn&#x2019;t brought anything with her but riding clothes, and women who planned on being married usually thought about what they&#x2019;d wear&nbsp;... unless she&#x2019;d wanted to be able to insist she hadn&#x2019;t known. And that was also very possible. He&#x2019;d gone over all those possibilities for weeks, and probably always would&nbsp;... and he suspected she had planned that, as well.<br>He smiled.<br>&#x201c;What is that smile for?&#x201d; she asked, again in Bovarian, the language in which they conversed when alone&#x2014;or in dealing with Bhayar.<br>&#x201c;I was just thinking about the depths behind those seemingly guileless brown eyes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I cannot believe you are interested solely in <i>those</i> depths.&#x201d; Her slightly husky voice was both warm and slightly sardonic.<br>Quaeryt found himself blushing.<br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Enough, lovely woman,&#x201d; he declared with mock gruffness. &#x201c;Your brother did say that we were to keep each other warm.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How, dearest, can I do that if you insist on getting out of this warm coverlet in this chilly bedchamber?&#x201d;<br>Eventually, Quaeryt did leave the bed, as did Vaelora, and they washed and dressed quickly. Quaeryt was more than grateful for the warm water waiting in the bath chamber. Just the thought of the cold water in the officers&#x2019; quarters made him shiver.<br>Although Governor Straesyr, when he had been princeps, had lived with his wife and family in one of the row houses along the north wall of the Telaryn Palace, Bhayar had declared that such quarters were not suited to his sister. Quaeryt had suggested that the apartments on the upper east end of the palace proper&#x2014;those that had been occupied by Tyrena, the daughter of the last Khanar of Tilbor before its conquest by Bhayar&#x2019;s father&#x2014;were most suitable for a princeps and that it would be most incongruous&#x2014;not to mention grossly unfair&#x2014;for the newly wed princeps to occupy the larger apartments of the former Khanar when his superior was the governor. That arrangement had been accepted by Bhayar and Vaelora and had certainly obviated possible tensions between Governor Straesyr and Quaeryt.<br>As Quaeryt began to pull on the fine browns of a scholar that Vaelora had insisted that he have tailored&#x2014;because a princeps needed to look the position, as well as carry it out&#x2014;he glanced at his left arm. It was still thinner than his right, while the skin was paler, not that his skin, ever so slightly darker than the pale honeyed shade of his wife&#x2019;s complexion, would ever approximate the near bluish white of the Bovarian High Holders and royal family. Given the beating his body had taken in the battles against the rebel hill holders, he was glad that none of the injuries had been permanent, unlike his left leg, shorter than his right, presumably since birth, since he didn&#x2019;t recall it ever being other than that.<br>Quaeryt waited until Vaelora was dressed&#x2014;in light brown trousers, a cream blouse, and a woolen jacket that matched her trousers&#x2014;before walking with her down the short corridor to the small cherry-paneled private dining room that had once been graced by Tyrena, who had been Khanara in fact, if not in name. There the ceramic stove radiated a comforting warmth.<br>Quaeryt seated Vaelora on one side of the table, then took his place to her left, at the end of the table, where Vaelora had insisted he belonged from the very first day of their marriage. In moments, a ranker in a winter-green uniform appeared with a teapot, a basket of warm dark bread, and a platter on which were cheese omelets and fried potatoes&#x2014;exactly the same fare as in the officers&#x2019; mess, if served on porcelain, and if not quite so warm.<br>Quaeryt poured her tea, then his. &#x201c;I do enjoy breakfast with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As opposed to dinner?&#x201d; She raised her eyebrows.<br>&#x201c;No. As well as dinner.&#x201d; He grinned, enjoying the game, holding the platter so that she could serve herself.<br>&#x201c;What will you do today?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What I do every day. I have a meeting at eighth glass with Cohausyt&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the one with the sawmills who wants to pay to harvest timber on the lands Bhayar got from the rebel hill holders?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one. I put him off because I needed to find out what finished timber and planking goes for in Tilbora.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you?&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt snorted. &#x201c;In a way. I ended up finding out what the carpenters and cabinetmakers pay for wood. I had to work backward from that. Later, I have to meet with Raurem&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a produce and grain factor&#x2014;to see if he can supply grain cakes for the regiments.&#x201d; After eating several mouthfuls, and taking a swallow of the tea, he asked, &#x201c;How are your plans coming for the spring reception?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Madame Straesyr has been somewhat helpful&nbsp;... as has Eluisa D&#x2019;Taelmyn.&#x201d;<br><i>Eluisa D&#x2019;Taelmyn?</i> Then Quaeryt realized she was talking about Rescalyn&#x2019;s mistress, the Bovarian High Holder&#x2019;s daughter the former governor had introduced as Mistress Eluisa. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s still here? I thought she had never married.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her father&#x2019;s name. He&#x2019;s one of the lesser Bovarian High Holders. She has nowhere else to go, and Emra begged her husband to let her stay and teach their children singing and how to play the clavecin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I heard her play once.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You told me. So did she. You upset her, you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I had that feeling. I was trying to see if Kharst was as terrible as they say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s worse, according to Eluisa.&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt wasn&#x2019;t about to pursue that subject. &#x201c;From your tone, I take it that neither one has been that helpful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re really only interested in the wives of High Holders, not the wives of factors.&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt wanted to shake his head. &#x201c;How are your writings coming?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I write some every day.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;The palace library has so many wonderful books.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know. I even read parts of some of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You did mention that.&#x201d; Vaelora took a sip of tea. &#x201c;I wish this were hotter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They have to carry it up from the kitchen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know. What do you think she was like?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Quaeryt had no idea to whom his wife was referring.<br>&#x201c;Tyrena. The Khanara who wasn&#x2019;t. You told me about those few scraps of paper you found with her writing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She was too strong in a situation where there were no intelligent men to marry and manipulate.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you suggesting...?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Quaeryt laughed. &#x201c;All men react to women. All women react to men. Intelligent men and women react intelligently.&#x201d; <i>Usually, but not always, unfortunately.</i> &#x201c;From all the documents I&#x2019;ve read, none of the men in power after her father fell too ill to understand were intelligent enough to listen to her. Probably the only man in Telaryn who might have been was your brother, and he&#x2019;s much better off with Aelina.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why do you say that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because you said that, and you know them both far better than I do.&#x201d; He swallowed the last of his omelet, and the remainder of his tea. &#x201c;I need to go.&#x201d; He stood, then moved beside her chair, bent and kissed her neck. After a long moment, he straightened.<br>&#x201c;Remember,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;make the factors explain. In detail.&#x201d;<br>Quaeryt smiled. &#x201c;Yes, dearest.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re close to disrespecting me.&#x201d; Her tone was bantering.<br>&#x201c;Close doesn&#x2019;t count.&#x201d; <i>Except in bed.</i><br>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking.&#x201d;<br>He managed not to blush. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you later.&#x201d;<br>After leaving the third-level apartments, he made his way down the circular staircase to the second level, and then to the princeps&#x2019;s anteroom and the study beyond. After almost a month and a half as Princeps of Tilbor, he was still slightly amazed when he walked into the study, although the view to the northern walls and the hills beyond was largely blocked in winter by the mostly closed shutters and hangings.<br>Princeps or not, he still met with Straesyr at the seventh glass of the morning every Lundi, and once he had checked with Vhorym, the squad lea...</p><h2>Ill Nature: Rants and Reflections on Humanity and Other Animals</h2><p>Williams tackles a host of controversial subjects in this collection of nineteen impassioned essays dealing mostly with humanity's abuses of the natural world.<br></p><p>Best known as a novelist, but also an accomplished journalist, Joy Williams has a great gift for inducing guilt trips. No one is safe: in the opening pages of <i>Ill Nature</i>, she implicates every First Worlder in creation for causing the death of the natural world, the victim of our material urges. She writes that the thousands of new digital television towers being erected today, for example, are responsible for the deaths of millions of songbirds that unwittingly slam into them or their guylines in midflight; by extension, anyone who owns a digital TV set is partly to blame for this unforeseen episode in the larger ecological crisis, no matter how well-intentioned those viewers may be.<p> Turning a sharp eye on ecotourists, zoogoers, hunters, politicians, developers, expectant mothers, carnivores, conservatives, liberals, and just about anyone else who crosses her path, Williams decries the rapid loss of the wild, which in her eyes is no mere abstraction. Sometimes hyperbolic, but more often right on target, she argues that it will take more than a few cosmetic fixes to mend all the wounds that the environment has sustained. Dystopian to the last (as she writes, "You are increasingly looking at and living in proxy environments created by substitution and simulation," and not the real world at all), Williams brings plenty of heat to the page--and plenty of light, too. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Most of us watch with mild concern the fast disappearing wild spaces or the recurrence of pollution - related crises such as oil spills, toxic blooms in fertilizer-enriched rivers, and the increasing violence in our own country. Joy Williams does much more than watch. With guts and passion, she sounds the alarm over the general disconnection from the natural world that our consumer culture has created. The culling of elephants, electron-probed chimpanzees, and the vanishing wetlands are just some of her subjects. Razor-sharp, controversial, scathingly opinionated, and refreshingly unafraid of conflict, Williams refuses to compromise as she lashes out at the greed of Americans and decries our own turpitude. It is not enough to mourn the passing of the natural world, Ill Nature shouts. Get out of our homes and our cars and our cubicles and do something...now.

Will it be too hard to bear?<br><br> There's horse trouble in Montana again. Only this time, horses aren't being stolen, they're being shot. Snipers are driving a blue pickup and shooting selectively. No hard-working ranch horse or Amish horse and buggy is safe. Still, Sadie rides, despite daily warnings from Dorothy down in the kitchen of Aspen East Ranch. But Sadie's getting used to ignoring Dorothy's advice. Sadie's heart is set on Mark even though Dorothy tells her to steer clear after he ditches her in the middle of their first date.<br><br> Then Daniel appears&#x2014;a visitor from Lancaster County. With cornflower-blue eyes and a strong, square jaw, he is everything that Mark is not. He's funny, well-mannered, and completely dedicated to his family. Mark, on the other hand, finds it hard to tell Sadie the secrets of his past. He tells her pieces of the shadowy story, then won't speak to her for weeks. Sadie's troubles continue at home when she discovers that her youngest sister, Anna, is struggling with bulimia. As Sadie's world spins out of control, her palomino, Paris, remains her sole confidant. But does Sadie put Paris in danger every time they go riding? Or, together, can they discover who these mysterious snipers are? Will Mark help her? Or is he one of the horse-hunters? Why, Sadie wonders desperately, are there so many secrets?

Translated by Stanislaw Bara�nczak and Clare Cavanagh.<br></p><p>All poets, according to Wislawa Szymborska, are in a perpetual dialogue with the phrase <i>I don't know</i>. "Each poem," she writes in her 1996 Nobel Lecture, "marks an effort to answer this statement, but as soon as the final period hits the page, the poet begins to hesitate, starts to realize that this particular answer was pure makeshift, absolutely inadequate." As a self-portrait, at least, this is fairly accurate. From the beginning, Szymborska has indeed wrestled with the demon of epistemology. Yet even in her earliest poems, such as "Atlantis," she delivered her speculations with a human--which is to say, a gently ironic--face: <p> <i>They were or they weren't.<br> On an island or not.<br> An ocean or not an ocean<br> Swallowed them up or it didn't.</i><br> </p><p> Fifteen years later, when her 1972 collection, <i>Could Have</i>, appeared, Szymborska seemed to have made some major inroads into her notorious ignorance. Now she confessed to at least a shred of comprehension, stressing, however, that such knowledge has come at a terrible price: "We read the letters of the dead like helpless gods, / but gods, nonetheless, since we know the dates that follow. / We know which debts will never be repaid. / Which widows will remarry with the corpse still warm." And even in her most recent work, the poet continues to gravitate toward the admirable emptiness of, say, the clouds: "Unburdened by memory of any kind, / they float easily over the facts." Ultimately, though, the joke is on Szymborska, whose poems have grown more witty, more humane, and more tender--in other words, more <i>knowing</i>--with each passing year. <i>View with a Grain of Sand</i> remains an excellent point of entry to Szymborska's oeuvre, but <i>Poems New and Collected</i> is the place to go for a wide-angle view of this superlative and sardonic writer.</p>WISLAWA SZYMBORSKA was born in 1923. She has worked as an editor, translator and columnist, though she is best known internationally as a poet. Wislawa was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996. She lives in Krakow, Poland.</p><h2>Food Enzymes for Health &amp; Longevity</h2><p>Revised and enlarged 2nd edition, this book includes much of the research material utilized by Dr. Howell to develop the &#34;food enzyme concept.&#34; It also includes hundreds of references to support the conclusions and sets forth a number of principles.</p><p></p><h2>Hit-Monkey: Year of the Monkey</h2><p>A troubled soul, set upon a path of vengeance he does not understand.

Over a half million Liaden Universe� books sold with an audience that keeps growing!<br><br>Star-trading Clan Korval&#x2014;known to Terrans as the Tree-and-Dragon Family and to the locals simply as "the Dragon"&#x2014;has been convicted of crimes against the homeworld. No matter that one of the "crimes" consisted of saving the elitist planet of Liad from very real internal threats, the Council of Clans wanted Korval heads to roll. Unfortunately for the Council, the Dragon's allies conspired to impose a milder punishment for saving the world: banishment, rather than execution.<br> <br> Now relocated to the free-for-all world of Surebleak, the Dragon is under contract to keep the Port Road open to all traffic, and to back the New Bosses in imposing law and order on a society originally based on larceny and assassination. This modest rustication is going surprisingly well, until Korval discovers that the enemy they'd sought to destroy. . .wasn't <i>quite</i> destroyed, and is more determined than ever to eradicate Korval.<br> <br> While the banishment killed no one initially, many of Korval&#x2019;s trading allies are spooked, and some are reneging on ancient agreements, leaving the Dragon to make its own way. The clan&#x2019;s efforts to stealthily recruit new allies is going haywire, and a secret death toll is rising even as the clan&#x2019;s adherents endure increasing exposure to danger and deceit off-world.<br> <br> To make matters worse, an active portion of Surebleak's native population liked the Old Ways just fine, and are conspiring to take the New Bosses&#x2014;and the Dragon&#x2014;down, and are sure they have the firepower and people to do it.<br> <br> The exiled Dragon has to make an urgent choice&#x2014;accept an alliance with criminals or face down each and every enemy in person, one by one.<br> <br> <b>About <i>Dragon in Exile</i>:</b><br> &#x201c;[S]prawling and satisfying. . . .

The handbook discusses the spectrum of restorative techniques, offers implementation guidelines, explains how and why the processes work, and relates real-world stories of restorative practices in action. Note about the second edition. Since the first edition of this book was written in 2009, hundreds more schools across the U.S. and the world have implemented restorative practices. Research studies have been conducted to examine how restorative practices may best be implemented. The changes to this new edition have been minor, however. We replaced some older stories with relevant new anecdotes. Several theoretical points have been clarified. More emphasis has been placed on the proactive use of restorative practices, especially circles. We&#39;ve also added examples of how administrators may use restorative practices with teachers and other staff. Thanks to IIRP Lecturer Mary Jo Hebling for her careful reading and her thoughtful suggestions and anecdotes that we&#39;ve incorporated in this edition.</p><p></p><h2>Batman Arkham: Mister Freeze</h2><p>An expert in the field of cryogenics, Victor Fries led a relatively normal existence.

Gordon has written more than sixty books for kids and young adults, including Zoobreak, Swindle, and Son of the Mob, as well as the On the Run series and the Island, Everest, Dive, and Kidnapped trilogies. A native of Ontario, Canada, Korman now lives with his family in Long Island, New York.Grade 4-6-Prolific Korman once again successfully employs his tried-and-true formula: zany situations; a fast pace; likable, well-drawn characters; contemporary dialogue; and lots of humor. In this current offering, he combines several unlikely sixth-graders from Minnesota's South Middle School, including a hotshot hockey star; an animal-rights activist steeped in pop psychology; a computer nerd who writes slimy, bloody screenplays; and a young scientist trying to fit into a new school as well as impress his Nobel Prize-winning scientist father. When a chicken named Henrietta, the key component of Milo Neal's science-fair project on food chains, also becomes the hockey team's mascot and only chance at winning the championship, conflict ensues. Feelings escalate when the students realize that Milo's plan for completing the link in the chain actually involves fried chicken, and a series of highly improbable but very funny events occur. That computer nerd Zach, who has never been on the team, is discovered to be an awesome goalie is perhaps the biggest stretch of all, and yet perfect in the context of the book. Similarly, the resolution is neat, pat, and yet satisfying. Told from alternating first-person perspectives that nicely reveal lots about each character, the novel is sure to appeal to Korman's many fans who are willing to suspend disbelief for a rollicking story.<br><i>Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Country House Companion</h2><p>Profusely illiustrated, an insider&#39;s look at the English aristocracy at play at their grand country estates.</p><p></p><h2>My Life (Green Integer Books, 39)</h2><p><p>Recognized today as one of the great works of contemporary American literature, My Life is at once poetic autobiography, personal narrative, a woman&#x2019;s fiction, and an ongoing dialogue with the poet and her experience.

Published by Penguin Press HC, The,2011, Binding: Hardcover</p><p><b>An enormously entertaining account of the gifted and eccentric directors who gave us the golden age of modern horror in the 1970s, bringing a new brand of politics and gritty realism to the genre. </b> <br><br> Much has been written about the storied New Hollywood of the 1970s, but at the same time as Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Francis Ford Coppola were making their first classic movies, a parallel universe of directors gave birth to the modern horror film-aggressive, raw, and utterly original. Based on unprecedented access to the genre's major players, <i>The New York Times</i>'s critic Jason Zinoman's <i>Shock Value</i> delivers the first definitive account of horror's golden age. <br><br> By the late 1960s, horror was stuck in the past, confined mostly to drive-in theaters and exploitation houses, and shunned by critics. <i>Shock Value</i> tells the unlikely story of how the much-disparaged horror film became an ambitious art form while also conquering the multiplex. Directors such as Wes Craven, Roman Polanski, John Carpenter, and Brian De Palma- counterculture types operating largely outside the confines of Hollywood-revolutionized the genre, exploding taboos and bringing a gritty aesthetic, confrontational style, and political edge to horror. Zinoman recounts how these directors produced such classics as <i>Rosemary's Baby, Carrie, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, and <i>Halloween</i>, creating a template for horror that has been imitated relentlessly but whose originality has rarely been matched. <br><br> This new kind of film dispensed with the old vampires and werewolves and instead assaulted audiences with portraits of serial killers, the dark side of suburbia, and a brand of nihilistic violence that had never been seen before. <i>Shock Value</i> tells the improbable stories behind the making of these movies, which were often directed by obsessive and insecure young men working on shoestring budgets, were funded by sketchy investors, and starred porn stars. But once <i>The Exorcist</i> became the highest grossing film in America, Hollywood took notice. <br><br> The classic horror films of the 1970s have now spawned a billion-dollar industry, but they have also penetrated deep into the American consciousness. Quite literally, Zinoman reveals, these movies have taught us what to be afraid of. Drawing on interviews with hundreds of the most important artists in horror, <i>Shock Value</i> is an enthralling and personality-driven account of an overlooked but hugely influential golden age in American film. <br><br><strong>What's Inside <i>Shock Value</i></strong> <br> <p><strong>Hitchcock is not the Godfather of the horror film:</strong> Moreover, the greatest horror directors of this era were actually reacting against him, as much as paying homage to him. This is particularly true of the end of <i>Psycho</i>, which horror makers hated as much as they loved the shower scene. This is a new argument that is at odds with most everything written about the genre. </p> <p><strong>The origins of horror tropes:</strong> Zinoman does a masterful job of tracing the origins of those now familiar horror standbys: the masked serial killer, the point of view shot in slasher films, the use of the chainsaw, the introduction of Gigerâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�s aesthetic (H.R. Giger was a painter and sculptor; the now-seminal design for the alien in <i>Alien</i> was inspired by his painting <i>Necronom IV</i> and earned him an Oscar in 1980); and the roots of the unmotivated serial killer. </p> <p><strong>Solving the "Monster Problem":</strong> This is a term Zinoman coins, which essentially means how do you retain the sense of the unknown (the "unknown" being the scariest thing in the world according to the intellectual Godfather of the genre, H.P. Lovecraft) while showing the monster? Every great horror movie of this period provides a good answer to this problem, and Zinoman shows exactly how the directors did it. </p> <p><strong>The slow embrace of the mainstream press to horror:</strong> In the 70s, the mediaâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�s coverage of horror radically evolved. Roger Ebertâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�s pan of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> in <i>Readerâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�s Digest</i> helped launch a new kind of alternative horror press which took horror very seriously at least a decade before the major critics. Now of course almost everyone, from A.O. Scott to Anthony Lane, does. </p> <p><strong>Tracing the origins of the two greatest monster movies of the era--<i>Alien</i> and <i>Halloween</i>:</strong> Zinoman explores in detail the influential friendship at USC in the late sixties between John Carpenter and Dan Oâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�Bannon. Zinoman is the first journalist to really reconstruct the USC scene (and almost the entire class), back before film school was really that popular. </p> <p><strong>Wes Craven:</strong> Zinoman explores how a fundamentalist upbringing and an early career in porn inspired Craven to be a master of horror. </p> <p><strong>Brian De Palma:</strong> The common wisdom about this director has been completely wrong. Despite his reputation as a coolly stylish director who emphasizes form over content, Zinoman shows how De Palmaâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�s movies are actually very personal, even autobiographical. To take one example, his greatest theme--voyeurism, which shows up in everything from <i>Carrie</i> to <i>Scarface</i> to <i>Blow Out</i>-â�&#x201a;��&#x20ac;&#x153;did not originate as an homage to Hitchcockâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�s <i>Vertigo</i>, as everyone including him says, but rather in the story of De Palma, as a child, spying and catching his father cheating (De Palma videotaped his father meeting-up with his mistress so that his mother could win in a divorce). </p> <p><strong>The making of <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>:</strong> Much has been written about the insanity of making this film, but Zinoman colorfully reports on the unlikely role of the New York mob and the Governor of Texas had in producing perhaps the most original exploitation movie of all time. Zinoman captures a Wild West period at the birth of the Texas film industry, when a classic horror movie could be made because a rich businessman wanted to sleep with the leading lady.</p>Jason Zinoman is a critic and reporter covering theater for <i>The New York Times</i>.

Edward Joesting tells for the first time the story of one of the most intriguing and least known of the Hawaiian Islands. His account begins with the prehistoric origins of the island and concludes with the annexation of Hawaii in 1898.<br><br><i>Kauai</i> describes the early emergence of Kauai as an island separate and distinctive from the other islands of Hawaii. It recounts the coming of Western man, the failure of King Kamehameha to conquer the island, and the ultimate incorporation of the island into the Hawaiian kingdom. Joesting also includes in his story the destructive impact of the sandalwood and whaling trades, and the subsequent rise of an economy based on sugar cultivation. His story comes to an end with the demise of the Hawaiian monarchy and the quiet revolution that occurred when Hawaii became a territory of the United States.<br><br>Historical documents not previously used bring new information and fresh perspectives to this book. The result is a level-headed, engaging look at Kauai. <i>Kauai: The Separate Kingdom</i> is certain to become the authoritative history of the island long regarded by many as the most beautiful in the Hawaiian archipelago.</p></p><p><b>Edward Joesting</b> is the author of <i>Hawaii: An Uncommon History.</i> In collaboration with the photographer Ansel Adams, Joesting wrote two other books on Hawaii.

As the novel opens, a group of villagers, led by Commander Yu, the narrator&#39;s grandfather, prepare to attack the advancing Japanese. Yu sends his 14-year-old son back home to get food for his men; but as Yu&#39;s wife returns through the sorghum fields with the food, the Japanese start firing and she is killed.

Partake of it in good health!</p><p></p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Red Sorghum</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>THE NINTH DAY of the eighth lunar month, 1939. My father, a bandit&#x2019;s offspring who had passed his fifteenth birthday, was joining the forces of Commander Yu Zhan&#x2019;ao, a man destined to become a legendary hero, to ambush a Japanese convoy on the Jiao-Ping highway. Grandma, a padded jacket over her shoulders, saw them to the edge of the village. &#x201c;Stop here,&#x201d; Commander Yu ordered her. She stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;Douguan, mind your foster-dad,&#x201d; she told my father. The sight of her large frame and the warm fragrance of her lined jacket chilled him. He shivered. His stomach growled.</p><p>Commander Yu patted him on the head and said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, foster-son.&#x201d;</p><p>Heaven and earth were in turmoil, the view was blurred. By then the soldiers&#x2019; muffled footsteps had moved far down the road. Father could still hear them, but a curtain of blue mist obscured the men themselves. Gripping tightly to Commander Yu&#x2019;s coat, he nearly flew down the path on churning legs. Grandma receded like a distant shore as the approaching sea of mist grew more tempestuous, holding on to Commander Yu was like clinging to the railing of a boat.</p><p>That was how Father rushed toward the uncarved granite marker that would rise above his grave in the bright-red sorghum fields of his hometown. A bare-assed little boy once led a white billy goat up to the weed-covered grave, and as it grazed in unhurried contentment, the boy pissed furiously on the grave and sang out: &#x201c;The sorghum is red&#x2014;the Japanese are coming&#x2014;compatriots, get ready&#x2014;fire your rifles and cannons&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Someone said that the little goatherd was me, but I don&#x2019;t know. I had learned to love Northeast Gaomi Township with all my heart, and to hate it with unbridled fury. I didn&#x2019;t realize until I&#x2019;d grown up that Northeast Gaomi Township is easily the most beautiful and most repulsive, most unusual and most common, most sacred and most corrupt, most heroic and most bastardly, hardest-drinking and hardest-loving place in the world. The people of my father&#x2019;s generation who lived there ate sorghum out of preference, planting as much of it as they could. In late autumn, during the eighth lunar month, vast stretches of red sorghum shimmered like a sea of blood. Tall and dense, it reeked of glory; cold and graceful, it promised enchantment; passionate and loving, it was tumultuous.</p><p>The autumn winds are cold and bleak, the sun&#x2019;s rays intense. White clouds, full and round, float in the tile-blue sky, casting full round purple shadows onto the sorghum fields below. Over decades that seem but a moment in time, lines of scarlet figures shuttled among the sorghum stalks to weave a vast human tapestry. They killed, they looted, and they defended their country in a valiant, stirring ballet that makes us unfilial descendants who now occupy the land pale by comparison. Surrounded by progress, I feel a nagging sense of our species&#x2019; regression.</p><p>After leaving the village, the troops marched down a narrow dirt path, the tramping of their feet merging with the rustling of weeds. The heavy mist was strangely animated, kaleidoscopic. Tiny droplets of water pooled into large drops on Father&#x2019;s face; clumps of hair stuck to his forehead. He was used to the delicate peppermint aroma and the slightly sweet yet pungent odor of ripe sorghum wafting over from the sides of the path&#x2014;nothing new there. But as they marched through the heavy mist, his nose detected a new, sickly-sweet odor, neither yellow nor red, blending with the smells of peppermint and sorghum to call up memories hidden deep in his soul.</p><p>Six days later, the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. A bright round moon climbed slowly in the sky above the solemn, silent sorghum fields, bathing the tassels in its light until they shimmered like mercury. Among the chiseled flecks of moonlight Father caught a whiff of the same sickly odor, far stronger than anything you might smell today. Commander Yu was leading him by the hand through the sorghum, where three hundred fellow villagers, heads pillowed on their arms, were strewn across the ground, their fresh blood turning the black earth into a sticky muck that made walking slow and difficult. The smell took their breath away. A pack of corpse-eating dogs sat in the field staring at Father and Commander Yu with glinting eyes. Commander Yu drew his pistol and fired&#x2014;a pair of eyes was extinguished. Another shot, another pair of eyes gone. The howling dogs scattered, then sat on their haunches once they were out of range, setting up a deafening chorus of angry barks as they gazed greedily, longingly at the corpses. The odor grew stronger.</p><p>&#x201c;Jap dogs!&#x201d; Commander Yu screamed. &#x201c;Jap sons of bitches!&#x201d; He emptied his pistol, scattering the dogs without a trace. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, son,&#x201d; he said. The two of them, one old and one young, threaded their way through the sorghum field, guided by the moon&#x2019;s rays. The odor saturating the field drenched Father&#x2019;s soul and would be his constant companion during the cruel months and years ahead.</p><p>Sorghum stems and leaves sizzled fiercely in the mist. The Black Water River, which flowed slowly through the swampy lowland, sang in the spreading mist, now loud, now soft, now far, now near. As they caught up with the troops, Father heard the tramping of feet and some coarse breathing fore and aft. The butt of a rifle noisily bumped someone else&#x2019;s. A foot crushed what sounded like a human bone. The man in front of Father coughed loudly. It was a familiar cough, calling to mind large ears that turned red with excitement. Large transparent ears covered with tiny blood vessels were the trademark of Wang Wenyi, a small man whose enlarged head was tucked down between his shoulders.</p><p>Father strained and squinted until his gaze bored through the mist: there was Wang Wenyi&#x2019;s head, jerking with each cough. Father thought back to when Wang was whipped on the parade ground, and how pitiful he had looked. He had just joined up with Commander Yu. Adjutant Ren ordered the recruits: Right face! Wang Wenyi stomped down joyfully, but where he intended to &#x201c;face&#x201d; was anyone&#x2019;s guess. Adjutant Ren smacked him across the backside with his whip, forcing a yelp from between his parted lips: Ouch, mother of my children! The expression on his face could have been a cry, or could have been a laugh. Some kids sprawled atop the wall hooted gleefully.</p><p>Now Commander Yu kicked Wang Wenyi in the backside.</p><p>&#x201c;Who said you could cough?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Commander Yu&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Wang Wenyi stifled a cough. &#x201c;My throat itches.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what? If you give away our position, it&#x2019;s your head!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Wang replied, as another coughing spell erupted.</p><p>Father sensed Commander Yu lurching forward to grab Wang Wenyi around the neck with both hands. Wang wheezed and gasped, but the coughing stopped.</p><p>Father also sensed Commander Yu&#x2019;s hands release Wang&#x2019;s neck; he even sensed the purple welts, like ripe grapes, left behind. Aggrieved gratitude filled Wang&#x2019;s deep-blue, frightened eyes.</p><p>The troops turned quickly into the sorghum, and Father knew instinctively that they were heading southeast. The dirt path was the only direct link between the Black Water River and the village. During the day it had a pale cast; the original black earth, the color of ebony, had been covered by the passage of countless animals: cloven hoofprints of oxen and goats, semicircular hoofprints of mules, horses, and donkeys; dried road apples left by horses, mules, and donkeys; wormy cow chips; and scattered goat pellets like little black beans. Father had taken this path so often that later on, as he suffered in the Japanese cinder pit, its image often flashed before his eyes. He never knew how many sexual comedies my grandma had performed on this dirt path, but I knew. And he never knew that her naked body, pure as glossy white jade, had lain on the black soil beneath the shadows of sorghum stalks, but I knew.</p><p>The surrounding mist grew more sluggish once they were in the sorghum field. The stalks screeched in secret resentment when the men and equipment bumped against them, sending large, mournful beads of water splashing to the ground. The water was ice-cold, clear and sparkling, and deliciously refreshing. Father looked up, and a large drop fell into his mouth. As the heavy curtain of mist parted gently, he watched the heads of sorghum stalks bend slowly down. The tough, pliable leaves, weighted down by the dew, sawed at his clothes and face. A breeze set the stalks above him rustling briefly; the gurgling of the Black Water River grew louder.</p><p>Father had gone swimming so often in the Black Water River that he seemed born to it. Grandma said that the sight of the river excited him more than the sight of his own mother. At the age of five, he could dive like a duckling, his little pink asshole bobbing above the surface, his feet sticking straight up. He knew that the muddy riverbed was black and shiny, and as spongy as soft tallow, and that the banks were covered with pale-green reeds and plantain the color of goose-down; coiling vines and stiff bone grass hugged the muddy ground, which was crisscrossed with the tracks of skittering crabs.</p><p>Autumn winds brought cool air, and wild geese flew through the sky heading south, their formation changing from a straight line one minute to a V the next. When the sorghum turned red, hordes of crabs the size of horse hooves scrambled onto the bank at night to search for food&#x2014;fresh cow dung and the rotting carcasses of dead animals&#x2014;among the clumps of river grass.</p><p>The sound of the river reminded Father of an autumn night during his childhood, when the foreman of our family business, Arhat Liu, named after Buddhist saints, took him crabbing on the riverbank. On that gray-purple night a golden breeze followed the course of the river. The sapphire-blue sky was deep and boundless, green-tinted stars shone brightly in the sky: the ladle of Ursa Major (signifying death), the basket of Sagittarius (representing life); Octans, the glass well, missing one of its tiles; the anxious Herd Boy (Altair), about to hang himself; the mournful Weaving Girl (Vega), about to drown herself in the river.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Uncle Arhat had been overseeing the work of the family distillery for decades, and Father scrambled to keep up with him as he would his own grandfather.</p><p>The weak light of the kerosene lamp bored a five-yard hole in the darkness. When water flowed into the halo of light, it was the cordial yellow of an overripe apricot. But cordial for only a fleeting moment, before it flowed on. In the surrounding darkness the water reflected a starry sky. Father and Uncle Arhat, rain capes over their shoulders, sat around the shaded lamp listening to the low gurgling of the river. Every so often they heard the excited screech of a fox calling to its mate in the sorghum fields beside the river. Father and Uncle Arhat sat quietly, listening with rapt respect to the whispered secrets of the land, as the smell of stinking river mud drifted over on the wind. Hordes of crabs attracted by the light skittered toward the lamp, where they formed a shifting, restless cloister. Father was so eager he nearly sprang to his feet, but Uncle Arhat held him by the shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;Take it easy! Greedy eaters never get the hot gruel.&#x201d; Holding his excitement in check, Father sat still. The crabs stopped as soon as they entered the ring of lamplight, and lined up head to tail, blotting out the ground.

As her organs failed, she entered into an extraordinary near-death experience where she realized her inherent worth...and the actual cause of her disease. Upon regaining consciousness, Anita found that her condition had improved so rapidly that she was able to be released from the hospital within weeks...without a trace of cancer in her body! Within these pages, Anita recounts stories of her childhood in Hong Kong, her challenge to establish her career and find true love, as well as how she eventually ended up in that hospital bed where she defied all medical knowledge. As part of a traditional Hindu family residing in a largely Chinese and British society, she had been pushed and pulled by cultural and religious customs since she had been a little girl. After years of struggling to forge her own path while trying to meet everyone else&#39;s expectations, she had the realization, as a result of her epiphany on the other side, that she had the power to heal herself ...and that there are miracles in the Universe that she had never even imagined. In &#34;Dying to Be Me&#34;, Anita freely shares all she has learned about illness, healing, fear, &#34;being love&#34;, and the true magnificence of each and every human being! This is a book that definitely makes the case that we are spiritual beings having a human experience ...and that we are all One.</p><p>Afterword<br> Before I close, I'd like to leave you with a few final words. Always remember not to surrender your power--instead, get in touch with your own magnificence. When it comes to finding the right path, there's a different answer for each person. The only universal solution I have is to love yourself unconditionally and be yourself fearlessly! This is the most important lesson I learned from my NDE, and I honestly feel that if I'd always known this, I never would have gotten cancer in the first place. <br> When we're true to ourselves, we become instruments of truth for the planet. Because we're all connected, we touch the lives of everyone around us, who then affect others. Our only obligation is to be the love we are and allow our answers to come from within in the way that's most appropriate for us. <br><br> Finally, I can't stress enough how important it is to enjoy yourself and not take yourself or life too seriously. One of the biggest flaws with many traditional spiritual systems is that they give you such a somber outlook. Although you know that I abhor creating doctrines, if I ever had to create a set of tenets for a spiritual path to healing, number one on my list would be to make sure to laugh as often as possible throughout every single day--and preferably laugh at myself. This would be hands down over and above any form of prayer, meditation, chanting, or diet reform. Day-to-day problems never seem as big when viewed through a veil of humor and love. <br><br> In this age of information technology, we're bombarded with news seemingly at the speed of light. We're living in an age of high stress and fear, and in the midst of trying to protect ourselves from everything we think is "out there," we've forgotten to enjoy ourselves and to take care of what's inside. <br><br> Our life is our prayer. It's our gift to this universe, and the memories we leave behind when we someday exit this world will be our legacy to our loved ones. We owe it to ourselves and to everyone around us to be happy and to spread that joy around. <br><br> If we can go through life armed with humor and the realization that we are love, we'll already be ahead of the game. Add a box of good chocolates into the mix, and we've really got a winning formula! <br><br> I wish you joy as you realize your magnificence and express yourself fearlessly in the world.<br> Namaste!Anita Moorjani was born in Singapore of Indian parents, moved to Hong Kong at the age of two, and has lived in Hong Kong most of her life. Because of her background and British education, she is multilingual and grew up speaking English, Cantonese, and an Indian dialect simultaneously; she later learned French at school. Anita had been working in the corporate world for many years before being diagnosed with cancer in April 2002. Her fascinating and moving near-death experience in early 2006 tremendously changed her perspective on life, and her work is now ingrained with the depths and insights she gained while in the other realm. As a result of her near-death experience, Anita is often invited to speak at conferences and events around the globe to share her insights. She&#39;s also a frequent guest at the University of Hong Kong&#39;s department of behavioral sciences, speaking on topics such as dealing with terminal illness, facing death, and the psychology of spiritual beliefs. She is the embodiment of the truth that we all have the inner power and wisdom to overcome even life&#39;s most adverse situations, as she&#39;s the living proof of this possibility. Anita currently lives in Hong Kong with her husband, and when she&#39;s not traveling and speaking at conferences, she works as an intercultural consultant for multinational corporations based in the city.

Difficulty breathing. Overwhelming dread. Andrea Petersen was first diagnosed with an&nbsp;anxiety disorder&nbsp;at the age of twenty, but she later realized that she had been experiencing panic attacks since childhood. With time her symptoms multiplied. She agonized over every odd physical sensation. She developed fears of driving on highways, going to movie theaters, even licking envelopes. Although having a name for her condition was an enormous relief, it was only the beginning of a journey to understand and master it&#x2014;one that took her from psychiatrists&#x2019; offices to yoga retreats to the Appalachian Trail.<br> &nbsp;<br> Woven into Petersen&#x2019;s personal story is a fascinating look at the biology of anxiety and the groundbreaking research that might point the way to new treatments. She compares psychoactive drugs to non-drug treatments, including biofeedback and exposure therapy. And she explores the role that genetics and the environment play in mental illness, visiting top neuroscientists and tracing her family history&#x2014;from her grandmother, who, plagued by paranoia,&nbsp;once tried to burn down her own house, to her young daughter, in whom Petersen sees shades of herself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Brave and empowering, this is essential reading for anyone who knows what it means to live on edge.</p><p><b>ANDREA PETERSEN</b> is a contributing writer at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, where she reports on psychology, health, and neuroscience.

I had symptoms of four. I was having panic attacks--sudden, intense periods of blinding terror, rapid breathing, and chest pain--several times a day (diagnosis: panic disorder). The rest of the time I worried, living with the nervous expectation of imminent disaster (diagnosis: generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD). I had developed a long list of particular fears, too: dentists, flying, driving on highways, taking medication, touching dirt, using a new tube of toothpaste, and licking envelopes. I did my best to avoid them all (diagnosis: specific phobia). My world was becoming smaller and smaller as more places became no-go zones: movie theaters, stadiums, lines. The potential for panic attacks--and the difficulty of escape--was too great (diagnosis: agoraphobia).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had symptoms of a couple of cousin disorders, too. A twisted perfectionism turned the smallest decision into a colossal obstacle; I felt a sense of sinister foreboding if I didn&#x2019;t choose the &#x201c;right&#x201d; dress to wear, the &#x201c;right&#x201d; water glass (diagnosis: obsessive-compulsive disorder). I agonized over every odd sensation or twinge of physical pain. A headache was clearly an aneurysm; a bruise, leukemia (diagnosis: illness anxiety disorder, previously called hypochondriasis).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The estimated number of people who will have at least one anxiety disorder during the course of their lives is staggering: one in three Americans ages thirteen or older. If we look only at women, the number is even higher--more than 40 percent. In any given year, about 40 million American adults have an anxiety disorder. And those numbers do not include the millions of garden-variety worriers and insomniacs whose anxiety, though not debilitating, leaches joy and steals peace of mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A certain amount of anxiety is good. It motivates us to study for tests, prepare for presentations, and save for retirement. It spurs us to get a physical or check the gas gauge. Too much anxiety, however, can be incapacitating and costly. In 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available, anxiety disorders cost the United States about $63 billion, more than half of it attributed to doctor and hospital visits. Other costs included psychiatric treatment, prescription drugs, and the value of lost productivity at work. There&#x2019;s also mounting evidence that out-of-control anxiety wreaks havoc on the body, increasing the risk of heart disease and suppressing the immune system. Ironically, being a hypochondriac may actually make you sick.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is tempting to think of our era--with its wars, terrorist attacks, rising sea levels, and economic insecurity--as, to borrow the poet W. H. Auden&#x2019;s phrase, &#x201c;the age of anxiety.&#x201d; But cultural commentators throughout history have viewed their own times as equally fraught. In the 1880s, the telegraph, the steam engine, and even women&#x2019;s intellectual pursuits were blamed for the nation&#x2019;s unease. In the 1950s, it was the atomic bomb. Our world, it seems, always provides ample fodder for fear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is disconcerting is that rates of anxiety disorders--and depression--seem to be increasing among young people, particularly college students. According to a spring 2016 survey by the American College Health Association, about 17 percent of students were diagnosed with or treated for anxiety problems during the previous year, and nearly 14 percent were diagnosed with or treated for depression. That is up from about 10 percent each for anxiety and depression in the fall 2008 survey. Parents and professionals are perplexed. While some of the rise may be because of increased prevalence, it could also be that more people are comfortable asking for help and admitting their troubles to researchers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Depression may get most of the headlines and the research dollars, but anxiety is more prevalent. In people with a history of both an anxiety and a mood disorder, anxiety usually makes an appearance first. Anxiety disorders strike young, too: They have a median age of onset of fifteen, compared with twenty-six for mood disorders. And while anxiety disorders are pretty miserable in and of themselves, they are increasingly being thought of as gateway illnesses that can lead to a host of other problems, such as depression, substance use, and even suicide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, anxiety can be deadly. Depression is the mental illness most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts, but it doesn&#x2019;t often lead to suicidal acts. Recent research has found that it is anxiety disorders and other illnesses, like problems with impulse control and addiction, that are more likely to lead to suicide attempts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, the consequences aren&#x2019;t fatal. Still, anxiety disorders can derail lives. Someone who develops an anxiety disorder at a young age is less likely to attend college. Anxious people who work have lower incomes. They are less likely to marry and, if they do, more likely to divorce. Anxious women face a greater risk of getting into unhealthy relationships and being the victim of domestic abuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That, thankfully, is not my story. If you met me now, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t even notice my anxiety. (When I began telling acquaintances the topic of this book, they almost uniformly said, &#x201c;I would never have guessed you&#x2019;re anxious.&#x201d;) I have a career I love, as a reporter writing stories for the Wall Street Journal. I&#x2019;m happily married, with an adorable seven-year-old daughter. I have friends, laugh a lot, go to parties, and bake pies. My affliction is often invisible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have had many advantages. I grew up in a loving home, lived in safe neighborhoods, and went to good schools. I have almost always had health insurance and the ability to pay for therapy and medication. While these privileges didn&#x2019;t prevent me from falling apart, I know they were critical in putting me back together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it has been a struggle. In tough years, I take medication and cycle through new therapies. In easy years, I still have to be diligent: Sleep eight hours. Do yoga. Take it easy on the wine. Pare down my responsibilities. And still I grapple with worry-induced insomnia. I tend to procrastinate, terrified of making the wrong choices. I have odd, unexplained physical symptoms--a tingling arm, chest pain. I can&#x2019;t drive on highways. Anxiety affects how I work, how I love, and how I parent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what is anxiety?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The DSM calls it &#x201c;anticipation of future threat.&#x201d; S�ren Kierkegaard, the nineteenth-century Danish philosopher, called it &#x201c;the dizziness of freedom.&#x201d; But the most cogent definition I&#x2019;ve heard comes from Christian Grillon, a neuroscientist at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). &#x201c;Anxiety is the anticipation of pain,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;It could be physical pain or emotional pain.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anxiety is related to fear but is distinct. Whereas fear is concrete and imminent, anxiety is, as Grillon says, &#x201c;sustained uncertainty.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a chronic sense of uneasiness about a vague future, a gnawing worry about what may or may not happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anxiety is universal, but the language we use to talk about it varies by culture, and so do its symptoms. The word anxiety comes from the Latin angere, which means &#x201c;to choke or throttle.&#x201d; In Cambodia, khyal (&#x201c;wind&#x201d;) attacks involve neck pain, dizziness, and ringing in the ears. In Vietnam, trung gio (&#x201c;wind-related&#x201d;) attacks are characterized by headaches. In Latin America, ataques de nervios (&#x201c;attacks of nerves&#x201d;) can include uncontrollable screaming and crying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Differing cultural perceptions of anxiety make it difficult to accurately compare rates of anxiety disorders in countries around the world. Yes, studies show that, in Japan, only about 4 percent of the population has an anxiety disorder in a given year, and that the French have a rate (13.7 percent) more than double that of the Spanish (6.6 percent). But these statistics are influenced by everything from how researchers define the word worry to who responds to surveys. (You could argue that the most anxious people are the least likely to answer a stranger&#x2019;s probing questions.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anxiety also exists on a continuum. There is no sharp boundary between mental health and mental illness, and no doubt other cultures draw the boundary differently than we do. When I asked Ron Kessler of Harvard Medical School, the country&#x2019;s leading mental health epidemiologist, why so many people have anxiety problems, he said it was because &#x201c;we have decided it is a disorder.&#x201d; Still, even if we have become alert to the idea that everyday anxieties can be symptoms of a disorder, a formal psychiatric diagnosis requires that the person suffer from &#x201c;clinically significant distress or impairment&#x201d; in functioning. No matter the symptoms or the name you give it, anxiety is a problem if it keeps you from living--and enjoying--your life the way you want to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve tangled with severe anxiety for more than twenty-five years. Looking back, my troubles didn&#x2019;t actually begin that December day in college, though it wasn&#x2019;t until then that it spiraled out of control. I had been having strange &#x201c;spells&#x201d; for months. They started when I was living at home the summer after my freshman year. During the day, I was working as a receptionist at a company that made steel forgings, the kind of place where the women were called by their first names while the men were all Mister So-and-so. At night, I waitressed at an Irish bar in East Lansing, where I checked fake IDs, dodged the advances of horny Michigan State guys, and learned to perfect the head on a pint of Miller Light. Between jobs, I took step aerobics classes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One night I was at the apartment of my boyfriend, Scott, a Michigan State student and Christopher Reeve doppelg�nger I had begun dating in high school. The evening&#x2019;s goal was, to paraphrase him, to get me high. I had tried smoking pot once or twice before but very tentatively. (I, seriously, tried not to inhale.) Frankly, I was afraid of it. I had been around enough of the stuff when I was a kid at my parents&#x2019; and my friends&#x2019; parents&#x2019; parties, the blue sheen of bongs glinting off Pledge-buffed coffee tables. Pot always seemed to make people silly and stupid. But Scott, an enthusiastic stoner, had been touting its effects for month. I was in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We started smoking a joint and waited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Take another hit,&#x201d; Scott said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did. And when Scott took one, he grabbed me and kissed me, blowing smoke into my mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Several more minutes went by.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then it hit me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My heart beat faster. My mouth went dry. I felt breathless. My equilibrium and vision contorted; it was as if I were on a roller coaster the moment before the big plummet. I lay down on Scott&#x2019;s bed, trying to take deep breaths and calm down. My legs felt like they were stretching, Alice in Wonderland style. I looked down and could have sworn I saw my feet on the other side of the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Desperate for distraction and wanting to feel grounded in some way, I reached for Scott and we started having sex. But I could barely feel him. My body was numb, deadened. I panicked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t breathe,&#x201d; I cried, sitting bolt upright.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure you can,&#x201d; Scott said, taking my hand. &#x201c;Just relax.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. And my heart is beating so fast, too fast,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Something must have been in that pot. It must have been laced with something.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I darted around the room, pacing and gulping air. &#x201c;Or maybe I&#x2019;m having an allergic reaction. Something is really wrong. I think I need to go to a hospital.&#x201d; I threw on sandals, a T-shirt, and a pair of Scott&#x2019;s boxer shorts. He scrambled to get dressed, too. I was already turning the doorknob to leave. Scott grabbed his car keys and followed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the ER, the bright lights, shiny linoleum, and bureaucratic questions sobered me up fairly quickly. I was not the only college student whose visit was spurred by chemical overindulgence. One drunken kid threw up on the waiting room floor. Another sobbed incoherently. In the exam room, a technician hooked me up to a heart monitor. A few hours later I was told I could go. A doctor scribbled my discharge instructions: &#x201c;Avoid THC,&#x201d; he wrote of the active chemical in marijuana.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did that easily. That one episode was more effective than an entire adolescence of antidrug After School Specials. But the spells of breathlessness, racing heart, and, increasingly, fear, recurred every month or so. They seemed to come from nowhere. I had one while eating fried cheese sticks at Bennigan&#x2019;s. I had another in the middle of a women&#x2019;s studies class. I feigned a bathroom emergency and spent the rest of the class crouched in a ladies&#x2019; room stall. The attacks subsided after twenty or thirty minutes but left me jelly-legged and shaky for hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t remember thinking much about the episodes during the intervals between them. I brushed them off, telling no one but Scott and hoping they&#x2019;d vanish as abruptly as they&#x2019;d begun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;1. the anticipation of pain</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6 estimated number of people: Ronald C.

Yet Joyce's genius was by no means immediately recognized, nor was his success easily won. At twenty-two he chose a life of exile; he battled poverty and financial dependency for much of his adult life; his out-of-wedlock relationship with Nora Barnacle was scandalous for the time; and the attitudes he held towards the Irish and Ireland, England, sexuality, politics, Catholicism, popular culture&#x2015;to name a few&#x2015;were complex, contradictory, and controversial.</p><p> Gordon Bowker draws on material recently come to light and reconsiders the two signal works produced about Joyce's life&#x2015;Herbert Gorman's authorized biography of 1939 and Richard Ellman's magisterial tome of 1959&#x2015;and, most importantly by binding together more intimately than has ever before been attempted the life and work of this singular artist, Gordon Bowker here gives us a masterful, fresh, eminently readable contribution to our understanding, both of Joyce's personality and of the monumental opus he created. </p><p> Bowker goes further than his predecessors in exploring Joyce's inner depths&#x2015;his ambivalent relationships to England, to his native Ireland, and to Judaism&#x2015;uncovering revealing evidence.

Joyce, ExilesIn a class-conscious society like British Ireland at the turn of the twentieth century, family origin was the main determinant of social status. For John Stanislaus Joyce and his son James, identity was inseparable from family - its historical line and ramifications. The ancestral presence reminded them of who they were and reinforced their sense of social distinction. As James's father began to squander his inheritance and the family descended into poverty, asserting claims to a distinguished ancestry became ever more important to him. Family associations, escutcheons and portraits became more meaningful, and the family legend passed on to his children became increasingly colourful and inventive.Two ideas were very important to James Joyce - that the Joyce family had distant Scandinavian origins, and that Daniel O'Connell, the Liberator, was a paternal ancestor. From his father he inherited portraits of various ghostly forebears, to which he added family portraits of his own. He had a close relationship with his mother and his bond with his father was strong and formative enough for many of the old man's eccentricities to shape his own personality. But he had very little time for his siblings, except Stanislaus, his next-eldest brother, George who died young, and Mabel who suffered the same fate. Consequently for him, as time went by, the past was more immediate than the present, and became the chosen playground of his fiction.His family had its Irish roots, he claimed, somewhere in the so-called Joyce country of County Galway, in the far west of Ireland, whence, it is said, come <i>all</i> Irish Joyces. They had migrated from Normandy to Wales following William's conquest of England, and thence to Galway following Cromwell's conquest of Ireland. For any imagination haunted by ghosts, here was a rich legendary past to inhabit and explore - as Joyce did in <i>Finnegans Wake.</i>1 But his immediate branch of the family, the historically present Joyces, had by the very late eighteenth century gravitated southwardsto County Cork, 'a southern offshoot of the tribe', or so he claimed.2The Joyces' recorded history originates with a certain George Joyce of Fermoy who begat the author's great-grandfather, James, born in Cork and married to Anne McCann, an Ulsterwoman. Great-Grandfather Joyce, a lime burner by trade, was by repute 'a fierce old fire-eater' and probably a member of the Whiteboys, a secret terrorist group operating in Munster during the 1820s, attacking the larger landed properties and acting to defend tenant farmers. He was said to have been arrested, tried, and barely escaped hanging, living on to establish himself as a successful building contractor.According to Peter Costello, unlike his strong-willed forebears, the son of James and Anne Joyce, James Augustine Joyce (1827-66), another Corkman, was 'little more than a feckless charmer; a typical man of the third generation only too happy to spend what his father and grandfather had won.'3 He was a horse-trader and reckless gambler who lost a great deal of money. Perhaps in the hope of stemming his excesses, his family married him off to a woman ten years his senior, Ellen O'Connell, an ex-nun. She was a member of the extensive O'Connell clan which included the great Daniel, MP for Clare and a dominant force in Irish politics during the first half of the nineteenth century. When James Augustine's business eventually failed, his father-in-law, Alderman John O'Connell, secured him a sinecure as Inspector of Hackney Coaches (or 'jingles'), with an office in the City Hall. Here, it has been suggested, is where the idea that the world owed the Joyces a living, which the author's father evidently inherited, first took root.4John Stanislaus Joyce, James's only offspring, was born in Cork city on 4 July 1849. James proved an affable father, but Ellen a sour and censorious mother. Although John was coached by a pious aunt, who later took the veil, he eventually became anticlerical, possibly influenced by his grandfather, old James Joyce, who believed that religion was only for women.Intent on transforming his son into a gentleman able to move in the highest circles of Irish society, on St Patrick's Day, 1859, John's father entered him at the newly established St Colman's College in Fermoy, but he was to remain under priestly eyes for barely a year. The youngest boy in the college, he was said to have been spoiled, and although not much of a scholar, acquired a ready wit and gained a familiarity with the priesthood which later he came to despise. He began to imbibe ideas of Fenianism from these men of the cloth and other boys at the college, as well as from those of his relatives prominent in Irish politics. Music and singing, a significant part of college life, became a significant part of John's life. He had 'a good treble voice', it was said, and 'sang at concerts at an early age',5 acquiring a passion for operatic arias and old Irish ballads,a passion communicated to James, the son who took after him most. Some of his favourite songs, such as 'Blarney Castle', formed part of young James's repertoire, and 'The Last Rose of Summer' became Mina Kennedy's favourite song in the 'Sirens' episode of <i>Ulysses.</i> John's stay at St Colman's was curtailed when he was withdrawn on 19 February 1860, either because his fees were unpaid, or after a severe attack of rheumatic fever rendered almost lethal by typhoid.6 After that, most likely he completed his education under private tuition.After St Colman's, John's parents resolved to build him up, and he began a programme of cold baths, exercise, rowing and athletics, which he claimed accounted for his relative longevity. There are allusions to this Spartan lifestyle in James's story 'The Sisters', and in <i>Ulysses</i> in Bloom's interest in the exercises of the German strongman, Eugen Sandow.7 As part of this regime, John's father arranged for him to work aboard a Cork Harbour pilot boat. There he acquired a stomach for sea travel and what his biographers call a 'vocabulary of abuse that for years was the delight of his bar-room cronies',8 able to draw upon a whole lexicon of inventive expletives. Favourites included 'Shite and onions!', 'I'll make you smell hell!' and, when things went badly for him later, 'Curse your bloody blatant soul ... Ye dirty pissabed, ye bloody-looking crooked-eyed son of a bitch. Ye dirty bloody corner-boy, you've a mouth like a bloody nigger.'9 The story of the seaman (D.B. Murphy) encountered by Bloom and Stephen at the cabman's shelter in the 'Eumeus' episode of <i>Ulysses,</i> full of hair-raising stories of treacherous foreigners, has the smack of John Stanislaus, the young salt, knocking around Cork Harbour. And the songs of Italian sailors, alluded to in the 'Sirens' episode, must have passed through John's musical memory into the creative imagination of his son.Later in life he followed the hounds, a love of the chase caught presumably from his father's love of horses. 'Begor, hunting was the game for me,' he told a journalist in old age.10 This passion is given voice in Ulysses, when, in 'Circe', the hunting cries 'Hol�! Hillyho!' and 'Bulblul Burblblburblb! Hai, boy!' echo between Bloom and Stephen amid the surrealistic anarchy of Bella Cohen's whorehouse. And John's habit of regular long walks around Dublin and environs, caught by his children, foreshadows the wandering narrative line which snakes through most of his son's fiction.Politics was a running theme throughout John's life. As well as the Fenianism imbibed as a schoolboy, two O'Connell uncles became town councillors in Cork, and one of his cousins, Peter Paul McSwiney, became Lord Mayor of Dublin. The 1860s saw the resurgence of a Fenian movement prepared to take up arms to liberate Ireland. Under their leader, James Stephens, they led an abortive uprising in February 1867, resultingin imprisonment for the rebels. The movement's conspiratorial air appealed to John, and while the extent of his involvement with it is unknown, escaping to university might have saved him from a stint behind bars.Although he gained entry to Queen's College, Cork, in October 1866, the death of John's father, who was barely forty, delayed his starting there until the following year. He chose to study medicine and found life as a medical student highly congenial - the conviviality, the drinking, the swapping of obscene anecdotes. Cherished memories of those carefree days were passed to his son who fed them into <i>A Portrait of the Artist.</i> John is said to have had 'stage presence', and the demands of student life did not prevent him from acting, singing comic songs at college concerts (including the then-popular 'Tim Finnegan's Wake'), and throwing himself into college sports. He was especially keen on field athletics and cricket, a passion his literary son inherited. In the 'Lotus-Eaters' chapter of Ulysses, Joyce recalls one celebrated Dublin cricketing hero:Heavenly weather really [muses Bloom] ... Cricket weather. Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out ... Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Buller broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.11John failed his second-year exams, and returned to college for a further year before leaving without a degree.In July 1870, at the age of twenty-one, he came into part of his inheritance, including properties in Cork yielding an annual income of some �500 from rents. Almost simultaneously the Franco-Prussian War broke out. It caused a sensation in Cork, with demonstrations and Irish volunteers rushing to the aid of the embattled Catholic French. John decided to join the fray, only to be intercepted in London by his mother and shipped straight back home.

It's nothing I have to think about. I've always felt that way. In the summer of 1984 when I was coaching the U.S. Olympic team, every stop I made, every group I talked to, I mentioned the eight greatest words any American ever put together: <i>America, America, God shed His grace on thee ...</i>Through the winter of 2000-01 when I was speaking to different groups across the country, I made it a point virtually every time to ask World War II veterans to stand, then all people who had served in the military in service to our country. I did it because I enjoyed seeing those people stand and hear applause, and I enjoyed being one of the people applauding. I strongly feel we are all blessed by being where we are when we are, and there are some specific people and generations who deserve to feel proud and appreciated--like the New York City firemen and policemen of September 2001.But this late-summer day in 1991 when I was pleasantly into my "only in America" reverie, I was wading in a river, fishing. The river was the Umba, in northern Russia. What I was thinking was that only in America could a guy like me, through a game like basketball, be standing there, having such a great experience.Because fishing that same day in that same river, just around a bend, was my friend, Ted Williams. Ted was as close to a lifelong hero as I had, outside my family. As a boy I sat in the stands at Lakefront Stadium in Cleveland and marveled at his swing. I was all for the Indians, but when I saw that classic Ted Williams swing send a baseball screaming into the stands and watched that head-down Williams lope around the bases, I felt privileged.The more I learned about him, the more I revered him--not only as a great baseball player but also as a genuine hero of two American wars; as a master fisherman; as one of the rare national figures who absolutely God-damned refused to knuckle under to a hostile press.Here I was, a kid from a small Ohio town, a town not far from Cleveland where my parents had taken me on a few special Sundays to watch the Boston Red Sox and the great Ted Williams play against the Indians. All these years later, I clearly remember the chill I felt when he just stepped into the batter's box, and when he swung, and the unbelievably special times when I was there and that swing and a loud crack sent the ball out of the park ... .And here I was, fishing with him ... because of basketball. I'm not too sure I've had another moment in my life when I felt more keenly, sharply aware of how much that game I loved had meant in my life.I met Ted Williams because basketball introduced me to some people who could make it happen--me, the son of two small-town Americans: an Ohio railroad man and a schoolteacher.I learned to fly-fish, my second-greatest sports passion, because of basketball. I was picked to make the trip, because of basketball. And I could afford to do it, because of basketball.I've spent most of my life trying to give things back to the sport, because so many people in it have given so much of it to me. That day, on that river, in that special company, I knew as I always had that I owed the game more than I could ever give back.But I was damned sure trying.Jerry McKinnis of ESPN's <i>Fishin' Hole</i> show lined up the Russian trip. I had fished several times in the United States for shows Jerry did. I enjoyed them all, because Jerry is a hell of a guy and the best fisherman (Ted would take exception) I've ever met.But he outdid himself by drawing up this trip. Jerry knew it, too. He's a big fan of both baseball and college basketball, a lifelong Cardinals fan who played the game well enough himself that he signed a professional contract coming out of high school. He knew from our previous travels and talks just where Ted Williams stood with me, and Ted had been Jerry's idol, too.I couldn't say yes fast enough when Jerry suggested the trip. And I couldn't have been happier when I called Ted and he said, yeah, he could do that--he'd be glad to. Ted and I had already met. I had mentioned to Minneapolis sports columnist Sid Hartman how much I thought of Ted Williams, and Sid got him to call me. The first time I met him face to face, Jimmy Russo set it up.Jimmy, an Indiana native who was the "superscout" for the Orioles during their great years in the '60s and '70s, was as strong an Indiana University basketball fan as I ever met. He lived in St. Louis and always got over to Bloomington at least once during the season, and I looked forward to those visits because we had some great baseball talks each time. Jimmy was still with the Orioles when I went to spring training after we had won the NCAA championship in 1981. Ted happened to be at a game both Jimmy and I attended, and Jimmy took me over and introduced me to him. We had maintained some contact over the years, so his agreement to go to Russia with me had some background.So did the trip itself. The summer of '91, baseball's All-Star Game was played in Toronto. President George Bush brought Ted and Joe DiMaggio to the White House for a ceremony, then the three of them got on a plane and went to the game. On the way, the president asked Ted about his summer plans. Ted told him about the fishing trip he and I were taking to Russia. "You and Knight?" the president said. "Jeez-us." History will record that we hadn't been out of the Soviet Union for a week before the government fell. We'd both like to take credit for that, but ...Ted and I met in New York for the flight over. We were sitting together on the airplane, not too far into the flight, when he said:"Okay, who do you think were the five most important Americans, in your lifetime?"The first thing that strikes you about him is how smart he is. You are not dealing with a guy with ordinary intelligence. He is well-read, extremely opinionated, and he backs up his opinions with reasons. A mutual friend, broadcaster Curt Gowdy, had told me to be ready to argue with him, because there was nothing Ted liked better than that. It wasn't the worst news I'd ever heard; I don't mind a little debate myself, now and then.And I knew from the way he asked me that question he had his own five.I mentioned Franklin Roosevelt, and he agreed, finally. I knew he was an arch-Republican, but I thought he'd have to come around on Roosevelt.He came in quickly with Richard Nixon, Joe Louis, and General Douglas MacArthur.I said Harry Truman, and he didn't totally agree. His contention was, "God-dammit, you have The Bomb. Anybody can decide to drop The Bomb." I'm a big Truman man. We argued about that point. Yes, anybody could have made that decision. I don't think just anybody would have.I picked George Marshall, the World War II general and the post-war secretaryof state who came up with the Marshall Plan that revived Europe. Ted didn't disagree with that.We both talked about Dwight Eisenhower. One guy I mentioned was Will Rogers.Ted was very big on Richard Nixon. He knew and liked Nixon. I wasn't inclined to argue. I think even some of Nixon's political critics feel he will go down as one of the better presidents. The negative was obvious: all the things represented by "I am not a crook."I mentioned, for personal reasons, William Simon. He knew Simon and thought he was a brilliant guy. We were talking twentieth century, so Henry Ford was another one we both picked. I don't remember if Thomas Edison came up or not, but he surely should have. This went on for a while.Then he wanted the five most overrated.I said John Kennedy, and I got out of the hole I had dug with FDR. "You're a hell of a lot smarter than I thought you were from our other discussion," he said.We both agreed that Robert McNamara and General William Westmoreland were on that list of five--three out of the same era.And we discussed baseball. He thought the best player ever was Babe Ruth. Period. He didn't think anybody was even close.He called Joe DiMaggio the best player of his era. I heard him say that many times. However, I wasn't going to accept that one without raising a point.I told him in 1947 when DiMaggio edged him out for MVP because one Boston writer didn't even put Ted in his top ten, DiMaggio shouldn't have accepted the award. He didn't say anything, just went to talking about something else, which was all I needed to feel that was exactly the way he would have handled the '47 situation.That was the quality that stood out for me during that whole conversation and has in every one I've had with him: how genuinely unfailingly gracious he is to players of his era who were supposed to be his rivals. Stan Musial, for example--"a great hitter and a great person," Ted called him.Williams quit playing after the 1960 season--after he homered in his last time at bat and gave John Updike the material for what may be the greatest sports story I've ever read. Updike was a graduate student at Harvard when he attended that game, sitting not in a press box but in the stands, as a fan. In an article entitled "Kid Bids Hub Fans Adieu" that he wrote for <i>The New Yorker,</i> Updike described Williams's eighth-inning home run, on a one-and-one pitch, off the Orioles' Jack Fisher, and his run around the bases: "He ran as he always ran out home runs--hurriedly, unsmiling, head down, as if our praise were a storm of rain to get out of." Updike was part of the crowd roar that ran forminutes in an attempt to get Williams to step out from the dugout and tip his cap. "The papers said that the other players, and even the umpires on the field, begged him to come out and acknowledge us in some way," Updike wrote, "but he never did and did not now."Gods do not answer letters."What a perfect line.Updike also said Williams, by declining to go with the team to New York for a meaningless three-game series closing out the season, "knew how to do even that, the hardest thing. Quit."But that almost wasn't Ted's last at-bat. In Russia he told me the Yankees tried to get him to play the next year, as a pinch-hitter and part-time outfielder--for the same salary he made with the Red Sox. Imagine what that would have been. "The next year" was 1961, the year Roger Maris hit sixty-one homers, and Mickey Mantle hit fifty-four. Now factor in Ted Williams, playing eighty-one games in the perfect stadium for a left-handed power hitter.I thought about all that and had to ask him, "How could you <i>not</i> play a year in Yankee Stadium?" He just decided he had played enough."It was really tempting," he said. "But I'd had my day."I had met Maris and become good friends with him. I think it's a shame that he died without ever being admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. I still think he will be, some day. Ted liked Maris, thought he was a great player, and worked hard to get him elected to the Hall of Fame.He's proud that he has the highest on-base percentage in baseball history--"so I got on base all the time, but I hit 500 home runs." That's why he liked Musial and DiMaggio, because they hit for average but hit with good power, too. Lou Gehrig also. Ted played against Gehrig, and he saw Ruth in batting practice a few years after Ruth's playing career ended in 1935.His teammate when he first came to the majors, Jimmy Foxx, was "a hell of a powerful hitter," Ted said. "There was a different sound to it when Foxx hit a baseball--like a cannon going off. Mantle was almost like that. He was a great player."He called Bob Feller the best pitcher he faced. I couldn't resist saying: "Yeah, sure--I listened to those Indians-Red Sox games and you must have hit .500 against him." He just glared.Feller, Virgil Trucks of Detroit, and Bob Lemon of Cleveland were his top three. The Yankees' Allie Reynolds and Vic Raschi, he said, were good pitchers but they played on a great team. He thought the Indians' Herb Score had a chance to be a great pitcher, until a line drive hit him in the face and he never was as good again.I just listened most of the time, fascinated. But occasionally I'd make a comment. And sometimes he would say, "God-dammit, you're not dumb. You aren't dumb."I told him of a conversation I had with Bill Dickey, the Hall of Fame catcher for the Yankees. I asked Dickey who was the fastest pitcher he faced. Before I could say the name, Ted cut right in: "He told you Lefty Grove was." He was right.And I was right in crediting basketball for providing me with this opportunity with Ted, one of the richest experiences of my life.&nbsp;<br>Ten years later, I still feel indebted to basketball. My address has changed, but not my gratitude toward the game. In fact, in the months after the initial shock of being fired in my thirtieth year as Indiana University's basketball coach, I still was thinking of the next step I wanted to make, the next experiment I wanted to try, in the search for improving my basketball team.I was fired September 10, 2000. I had already begun working with my team--a maximum of four players at a time, under NCAA rules, before full practice begins. October 15 was the first day that college basketball teams could practice in the 2000-01 season. The evening of October 14, the thought ran through my mind:<i>For the first time in thirty-six years, I don't have a basketball team.</i> ...It was the first time in a lot longer than that since a new season approached and I wasn't excited about getting it started. Add two years as an assistant coach at West Point; a year before that as a high school assistant at Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio; four years before that as a player at Ohio State; four years before that as a varsity high school player at Orrville, Ohio; and two years before that in junior high.I hadn't quite turned sixty, and it had been forty-nine years since a fresh, new basketball season arrived without my being involved with a team.The truth is I resented it like hell. I knew what I had set out to build at Indiana University. Winning games and championships was part of the dream going in, and not just as a by-product. I wanted to win those games and build those championship teams the way some people, primarily in the press, were saying could not be done anymore--by following NCAA rules; by recruiting kids who could and would be genuine students and four-year graduates as well as excellent basketball players and teams. I wanted to make the INDIANA they wore across their chests an identifying symbol that meant to people throughout the state, the Big Ten, and the country that inside that jerseywas a kid who would compete like hell and represent his school on the court and off it, during his college years and after them, in a way that would make the most important judges of all, that kid's parents, as proud as they could be.To do all that and to win was the goal.To win without doing all those things would have been to fail.When they took direction of the Indiana University basketball program away from me, it didn't change my feeling about those twenty-nine years.I had met my goal.And...</p><h2>Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel (Great Discoveries)</h2><p>A portrait of the eminent twentieth-century mathematician discusses his groundbreaking theorem of incompleteness, contributions within the famous Vienna circle, relationships with such contemporaries as Albert Einstein, and untimely death as a result of mental instability and self-starvation. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Kurt G�del is often held up as an intellectual revolutionary whose incompleteness theorem helped tear down the notion that there was anything certain about the universe. Philosophy professor, novelist, and MacArthur Fellow Rebecca Goldstein reinterprets the evidence and restores to G�del's famous idea the meaning he claimed he intended: that there is a mathematical truth--an objective certainty--underlying everything and existing independently of human thought. G�del, Goldstein maintains, was an intellectual heir to Plato whose sense of alienation from the positivists and postmodernists of the 1940s was only ameliorated by his friendship with another intellectual giant, Albert Einstein. As Goldstein writes, "That his work, like Einstein's, has been interpreted as not only consistent with the revolt against objectivity but also as among its most compelling driving forces is ... more than a little ironic."<p> This and other paradoxes of G�del's life are woven throughout <i>Incompleteness</i>, with biographical details taking something of a back seat to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of his theories. As an introduction to one of the three most profound scientific insights of the 20th century (the other two being Einstein's relativity and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle), <i>Incompleteness</i> is accessible, yet intellectually rigorous. Goldstein succeeds admirably in retiring inaccurate interpretations of G�del's ideas. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>MacArthur Fellow and Whiting-Award winner <b>Rebecca Goldstein</b> novels include <i>The Mind-Body Problem</i> and <i>Properties of Light</i>.

Liebling remain a vibrant role model for writers while the superb, prolific St. Clair McKelway has been sorely forgotten?" James Wolcott asked this question in a recent review of the Complete <i>New Yorker </i>on DVD. Anyone who has read a single paragraph of McKelway's work would struggle to provide an answer.</p><p>His articles for the <i>New Yorker </i>were defined by their clean language and incomporable wit, by his love of New York's rough edges and his affection for the working man (whether that work was come by honestly or not). Like Joseph Mitchell and A. J. Liebling, McKelway combined the unflagging curiosity of a great reporter with the narrative flair of a master storyteller. William Shawn, the magazine's long-time editor, described him as a writer with the "lightest of light touches." His style is so striking, Shawn went on to say, that "it was too odd to be imitated." </p><p>The pieces collected here are drawn from two of McKelway's books--<i>True Tales from the Annals of Crime and Rascality </i>(1951<i>) </i>and <i>The Big Little Man from Brooklyn </i>(1969). His subjects are the small players who in their particulars defined life in New York during the 36 years McKelway wrote: the junkmen, boxing cornermen, counterfeiters, con artists, fire marshals, priests, and beat cops and detectives. The "rascals." </p><p>An amazing portrait of a long forgotten New York by the reporter who helped establish and utterly defined <i>New Yorker </i>"fact writing," <i>Untitled Collection </i>is long overdue celebration of a truly gifted writer.</p></p><p>St. Clair McKelway came from a family of newspaper journalists and ministers. Born in 1905, in Charlotte, NC, he grew up in Washington, DC, and worked his first job as an office boy at the old <i>Washington Times-Herald. </i>He went on to report and edit for the <i>New York World</i>, the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. He eventually became a staff writer at the <i>New Yorker,</i> where he wrote for thirty years, and its managing editor from 1936-1939.

Tracks the history of that greatest of all cultural institutions." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></b> <br><br> Libraries are much more than mere collections of volumes. The best are magical, fabled places whose fame has become part of the cultural wealth they are designed to preserve. Some still exist today; some are lost, like those of Herculaneum and Alexandria; some have been sold or dispersed; and some never existed, such as those libraries imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien, Umberto Eco, and Jorge Luis Borges, among others.<br><br> Ancient libraries, grand baroque libraries, scientific libraries, memorial libraries, personal libraries, clandestine libraries: Stuart Kells tells the stories of their creators, their prizes, their secrets, and their fate. To research this book, Kells traveled around the world with his young family like modern-day &#x201c;Library Tourists.&#x201d; Kells discovered that all the world&#x2019;s libraries are connected in beautiful and complex ways, that in the history of libraries, fascinating patterns are created and repeated over centuries. More important, he learned that stories about libraries are stories about people, containing every possible human drama.<br><br> <i>The Library</i> is a fascinating and engaging exploration of libraries as places of beauty and wonder. It&#x2019;s a celebration of books as objects, a celebration of the anthropology and physicality of books and bookish space, and an account of the human side of these hallowed spaces by a leading and passionate bibliophile.</p><p><b>STUART KELLS</b> is an author and book-trade historian. His 2015 history of Penguin Books, <i>Penguin and the Lane Brothers</i>, won the prestigious Ashurst Business Literature Prize. <i>Rare</i>, his critically acclaimed biography of Kay Craddock&#x2015;the first female president of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers&#x2015;was published in 2011. An authority on rare books, Kells has written and published on many aspects of print culture and the book world.PREFACE<br><br> More than twenty years ago, when I was a young academic working glumly at a social research institute, one of the university colleges held a lunchtime book-sale. As soon as I arrived I found a smallish, squarish volume, handsomely printed in old-fashioned type. The binding was distinctively English: dark-blue, straight-grained morocco (a type of goatskin), the spine boldly gilded and segmented with raised bands in the style of Charles Lewis, the great nineteenth-century bookbinder.<br><br> The title page revealed the publication date, 1814, and identified the book as <i>Pieces of Ancient Poetry from Unpublished Manuscripts and Scarce Books</i>. I knew 'ancient' meant the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, and 'poetry' covered a breadth of ballads and verse. Otherwise, the book was a little mystery. Just two letters appeared where the author's name should have been: 'NY'. Nor was the publisher identified.<br><br> A footnote revealed ninety-six copies had been printed, plus six 'specials' on blue paper. The book in my hands was one of the six. I turned to the back and read the 'Disposition of the copies'. Though the book kept secret its author and publisher, it named Sheepshanks, Peckover, Pople and the other subscribers who had agreed in advance to buy a copy. Several of the listed men were Roxburghers, members of the world's most illustrious and exclusive bibliophile society: Sir Mark Masterman Sykes (a blue copy and a white copy), Sir Francis Freeling, Archdeacon Francis Wrangham, and (enjoying another book purchase before his imminent bankruptcy) George Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford.<br><br> Here, then, in pristine condition and with exceptional pedigree, was a beautifully made and exceptionally scarce collection of rare texts from the time of Shakespeare. In some quarters, leather-bound books are out of fashion. They are 'brown books' to go with 'brown furniture'. But finding Pieces was a perfect life moment, the kind of discovery that explains why bibliophiles spend much of their lives at flea markets, book stalls, car boots and garage sales. Walking home that day, I looked forward to showing the prize to my fianc� Fiona. We were living in a tower block that used to be a hotel; our apartment still had a minibar-fridge and a wall-mounted hairdryer. Fiona and I grappled with how best to accommodate our VIP guest. Archival box? Shelf to breathe? Would steam from the kitchenette bother the morocco?<br><br> Over the following weeks I researched Pieces, consulting in the Baillieu Library the <i>Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature</i> and a nineteenth-century edition of the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. 'NY', it turned out, was John Fry, a young bookseller from Bristol: N and Y are the terminal letters of his first and last names, a common device of ceremonial anonymity. (Fry's final book was even less anonymous: it identified its editor as 'J&#x2013;N F&#x2013;Y'.)<br><br> Fiona and I saved our money and searched for other Fries. Soon, in our tiny flat, we had the world's best John Fry collection (the Folger Shakespeare Library contained his other works but not Pieces) and we were beginning to appreciate fully our book-sale find. In strictly monetary terms, Pieces was the most valuable thing we owned. But it was more than an asset we could liquidate if we had to. It became for us a talisman. We had found the nucleus of our future library.<br><br> <i>Pieces</i> was also a treasure map, and a portal into multiple strands of a bookish life. John Fry admitted Fiona and I into the circle of gentlemen who, during the reign of King George III, preserved rare books and documents from centuries past. He tutored us on the pillars of good bibliographical method, and exposed us to the most sublime forms of bibliomania. He introduced us to black-letter men, gilt toppers, rough edgers, tall copyists, broadsiders, Aldusians, Elzevirians, Grangerites, pasquinaders and tawny moroccoites. He initiated us into Elizabethanism and invited us to celebrate the edgy side of Shakespeare's work. And he enlisted us into the search for Shakespeare's missing library.<br><br> The discovery sparked an epiphany somewhere between <i>On the Road and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>. I became a student again, determined to learn everything I needed to become a bookman. Nearby universities offered no degrees in vocational bookmanship. Inspired by Fry and his circle, I improvised my own course, plucking units from literature, psychology, philosophy, art, commerce, curatorship, history, law, logic, mathematics &#x2013; a mixture that made no sense to anyone but Fiona and me. When eventually I graduated, I walked away with a book about bookselling, a masters in book auctions, a doctorate in law, the untidiest transcript in Christendom, and a bespoke qualification in bibliophilia.<br><br> On weekends I started 'running' books: driving around with a car full mostly of paperbacks, wholesaling them between bookshops. Fiona and I issued catalogues of highlights from our stock. Every book we bought to sell was a puzzle, a judgement to be backed. We relished the chance to work with objects, not just ideas. For Fiona and I, this was the beginning of a career in books that saw us working side by side in a publishing house, and issuing with delight a series of books about books. We exhibited at bookfairs, and sold books to venerated libraries such as the Bodleian, whose users must swear not to remove or deface the objects therein, nor to set them on fire.<br><br> In the course of our work we visited hundreds of libraries. Libraries tidy and chaotic, dry and damp, fragrant and malodorous, welcoming and dangerous, containing nearly every kind of book: loved and neglected, meritorious and meretricious, read and unread. We explored national libraries, working men's libraries, subscription libraries, scholarly libraries, corporate libraries, club libraries, plush private libraries and very modest ones, like the collection of 'found' books amassed by a demolition man in the course of his labours, every volume methodically catalogued and lovingly preserved.<br><br> We ventured 'off-catalogue' to make exhilarating discoveries on library shelves, like mislaid pamphlets, overlooked signatures, legendary variants, extra-illustrated rarities and hidden fore-edge paintings. We explored restricted spaces inside libraries, like the exquisite Shakespeare Room in the State Library of New South Wales; the super-tight spiral staircases deep inside the State Library of Victoria; and the panopticon cavity above the vaulted glass dome of the nearby parliamentary library, modelled on the original Reichstag.<br><br> We studied the crimes of book owners, such as the farmers who stored in a woolshed a priceless set (forty-one elephant-folio volumes) of John Gould's marvellous zoological illustrations; and the farmers' town cousins who stored a unique collection of books and manuscripts in a fireplace. We called on the hoarder who cut an indoor pathway to his bathtub, where his most prized possessions were kept. And we swooned over medieval libraries with books shelved spine-inward and attached to chains to prevent escape.<br><br> We learnt that libraries are much more than mere accumulations of books. Every library has an atmosphere, even a spirit. Every visit to a library is an encounter with the ethereal phenomena of coherence, beauty and taste. But libraries are not Platonic abstractions or sterile, hyperbaric chambers. They are human places into which humans cry tears, moult hair, slough skin, sneeze snot and deposit oil from their hands &#x2013; incidentally the best sustenance for old leather bindings. How much of themselves did Shakespeare, Donne, Hemingway and Woolf leave behind in their libraries?<br><br> And how much of their personalities is discernible from their books? Creating a library is a psychically loaded enterprise. In gathering their bounty, booklovers have displayed anxiety, avarice, envy, fastidiousness, obsession, lust, pride, pretension, narcissism and agoraphobia &#x2013; indeed every Biblical sin and most of the pathologies from the American Psychiatric Association manual.<br><br> When visitors called on the seventeenth-century Welsh bibliophile Sir William Boothby, he wished they would hurry up and leave. 'My company is gone, so that now I hope to enjoy my selfe and books againe, which are the true pleasures of my life, all else is but vanity and noyse'. John Hill Burton described a book collector whose nervous temperament was so sensitive that he could not tolerate an alien book in proximity to his library; 'the existence within his dwelling-place of any book not of his own special kind, would impart to him the sort of feeling of uneasy horror which a bee is said to feel when an earwig comes into its cell.'<br><br> Collectors, having acquired and arranged their books through whichever means and by whatever schema, have used every kind of simile to describe their beloved possessions. Garden flowers, verdant leaves, precious fruit, flowing fountains. Ships, houses, bricks, doors, nails, bullets, daggers, windows, voices, songs, chapters, memories, scents, elixirs, cogs, coins, countries, toys, birds, worlds, meteorites, gems, friends, offspring, prisoners, tenants, soldiers, lovers, wraiths, devils, bones, eyes, teeth. John Baxter imagined the books in his Graham Greene collection rustling and rubbing against each other every night like a colony of insects.<br><br> Libraries provide ideal habitats for real insects, which are attracted to quiet, darkish, starchy places. Fiona and I have seen whole shelves of books destroyed by burrowing worms. For me now, the mounds and trails they left behind are the stuff of genuinely horrifying nightmares. We've also seen whole collections ruined by grazing silverfish, the bibliophile's nemesis. Those monsters relish pulpy paper and the crunchy starch in book glue and book cloth. Seemingly preferring richer inks, they devastate dust-jackets with tracks that look fiendishly deliberative.<br><br> From our visits to libraries we've also learnt much about the integrity of shelves. Smooth, strong and open are best. Sagging shelves deform books into painful, non-Euclidean shapes. Abrasive shelves wear away at leather bindings. Books behind glass get sick from breathing their own air.<br><br></p><h2>The Last Goodnight: A World War II Story of Espionage, Adventure, and Betrayal</h2><p><p><em>NEW YORK TIMES </em>BESTSELLER</p><p>The<em> New York Times</em> bestselling author of the acclaimed <em>Dark Invasion</em>, channels Erik Larson and Ben Macintyre in this riveting biography of Betty Pack, the dazzling American debutante who became an Allied spy during WWII and was hailed by OSS chief General &#x201c;Wild Bill" Donovan as &#x201c;the greatest unsung heroine of the war.&#x201d;</p><p>Betty Pack was charming, beautiful, and intelligent&#x2014;and she knew it.

Sebald, one of the most enormously acclaimed European writers of our time.</strong></p><em>Vertigo</em>, W. G. Sebald's first novel, never before translated into English, is perhaps his most amazing and certainly his most alarming. Sebald&#x2015;the acknowledged master of memory's uncanniness&#x2015;takes the painful pleasures of unknowability to new intensities in Vertigo. Here in their first flowering are the signature elements of Sebald's hugely acclaimed novels <em>The Emigrants</em> and <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>. An unnamed narrator, beset by nervous ailments, is again our guide on a hair-raising journey through the past and across Europe, amid restless literary ghosts&#x2015;Kafka, Stendhal, Casanova. In four dizzying sections, the narrator plunges the reader into vertigo, into that "swimming of the head," as Webster's defines it: in other words, into that state so unsettling, so fascinating, and so "stunning and strange," as <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> declared about <em>The Emigrants</em>, that it is "like a dream you want to last forever."</p><p>It is not often that books receive the universal critical acclaim with which W.G. Sebald's work in English translation has been met. Both <i>The Emigrants</i> and <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> won the sort of plaudits that would enable most writers to die happy. Sebald first employed his limpid, literally entrancing style in <i>Vertigo</i>, which appeared in German in 1990 and then waited a decade for its English-language debut. Like <i>The Emigrants</i>, this earlier novel interweaves four different narratives, which cumulatively sound a single, transcendent note--in this case, that of memory.<p> Sebald begins with Marie Henri Beyle (better known as Stendhal), cruising through the French author's painful and unreliable recollections of his military career. Then he splices in his own voyage through Italy, allowing these historical and personal perspectives to intersect when we least expect them to. As the book develops, it returns to the same locations: Milan, Verona, Venice, and the Alps. And in the course of this fractured meandering, the reader cohabits with a haunted Franz Kafka, admires the serene beauty of the stars above Lake Garda, and ultimately returns to Sebald's home in Bavaria, where the author confronts his childhood memories.</p><p> For Sebald, a straight line is <i>never</i> the shortest distance between two points: he more often travels in concentric circles, or cuts wild capers from past to present. Yet the stumbling journey in <i>Vertigo</i> seeks to replicate the distorted and unfathomable workings of memory itself. And it succeeds to an astonishing extent, so that the acts of traveling, recalling, and writing are impossible to tell apart: </p><blockquote> On this occasion in the midst of the holiday season, the night train from Vienna to Venice, on which in the late October of 1980 I had seen nobody except a pale-faced schoolmistress from New Zealand, was so overcrowded that I had to stand in the corridor all the way or crouch uncomfortably among suitcases and rucksacks, so that instead of drifting into sleep I slid into my memories. Or rather, the memories (at least so it seemed to me) rose higher and higher in some space outside of myself, until, having reached a certain level, they overflowed from that space into me, like water over the top of a weir. </blockquote> Thus is the writer inundated. And so, happily, are his readers--those lucky enough to take the plunge. <i>--Toby Green</i><p><strong>W. G. Sebald</strong> was born in Germany in 1944 and died in 2001. He is the author of <em>The Emigrants</em>, <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>, <em>Vertigo</em>, <em>Austerlitz</em>, <em>After Nature</em>, <em>On the Natural History of Destruction</em>, <em>Unrecounted</em> and <em>Campo Santo</em>.</p><p><strong>Michael Hulse</strong> is an English translator, critic, and poet.

She is also a poet, writer, amateur naturalist, and former classroom teacher. . The seeds of The Private Eye Project sprouted when she began seeking the habits of mind that are common denominators behind painters, poets, scientists, inventors, businesspersons, salespersons, great learners, and great teachers. By 1988 she d arrived at a theory, encapsulated in The Private Eye process. On a four-year grant from the Discuren Foundation, she piloted The Private Eye process in The Seattle Public Schools. In doing so she introduced jeweler s loupes (as a thinking tool) to the world of education, and identified the concept of thinking by analogy as the most powerful means to magnify minds. Students showed remarkable gains in ability to communicate, think creatively, and problem-solve. To date the nationally-acclaimed Private Eye program has spread to thousands of teachers (kindergarten through college) and over two million students in the United States and Canada.The Private Eye is a good buy for teachers and all who would learn more about the unique planet we live on.

After vanquishing a truly iniquitous collection of violent individuals, Billy moved his family to west Montana and hung out a shingle for his law practice. But in <i>In the Moon of Red Ponies,</i> he discovers that jail cells have revolving doors and that the government he had sworn to serve may have become his enemy. </p><p> His first client in Missoula is Johnny American Horse, a young activist for land preservation and the rights of Native Americans. Johnny is charged with the murder of two mysterious men -- who seem to have recently tried to kill Johnny themselves, or at least scare him off his political causes. As Billy Bob investigates, he discovers a web of intrigue surrounding the case and its players: Johnny's girlfriend, Amber Finley, as reckless as she is defiant -- and the daughter of one of Montana's U.S. senators; Darrel McComb, a Missoula police detective who is obsessed with Amber; and Seth Masterson, an enigmatic government agent whose presence in town makes Billy Bob wonder why Washington has become so concerned with an obscure murder case on the fringes of the Bitterroot Mountains. </p><p> As complications mount and the dead bodies multiply, Billy Bob is drawn closer to the truth behind Johnny American Horse's arrest -- and discovers a greater danger to himself and to his whole family.

He lived on the Flathead Reservation in the Jocko Valley, although his name came from the Lakota Sioux, and his relatives told me he was a descendant of Crazy Horse, the shaman and chief strategist for Red Cloud, who actually defeated the United States Army and shut down the Bozeman Trail in Red Cloud's War of 1868. I don't know whether or not Johnny experienced mystical visions as his ancestor supposedly did, but I had no doubt he heard voices, since he often smiled during the middle of a conversation and asked people to repeat themselves, explaining nonchalantly that other people were talking too loudly, although no one else was in the room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But on balance he was a decent and honorable man and a hard worker, who took pride in tree-planting the side of a bare hill or digging postholes from sunrise to dark, in the way ranch hands did years ago, when love of the work itself was sometimes more important than the money it paid. He was handsome, full of fun, his hands shiny with callus, his face usually cut with a grin, his coned-up straw hat slanted on his brow. His higher ambitions were quixotic and of a kind that are doomed to destruction, but he was never dissuaded by the world's rejection or the fate it would eventually impose on him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I just wished Johnny hadn't been so brave or so trusting in the rest of us.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Montana's history of rough justice is legendary. During the 1860s the Montana Vigilantes lynched twenty-two members of Henry Plummer's gang, riding through ten-foot snowdrifts to bounce them off cottonwood trees and barn ladders all over the state. Plummer's men died game, often toasting the mob with freshly popped bottles of champagne and shouting out salutes to Jefferson Davis before cashing in. Plummer, a county sheriff, was the only exception. He begged his executioners to saw off his arms and legs and cut out his tongue rather than take his life. The vigilantes listened quietly to his appeal, then hanged him from the crossbeam at the entrance to his ranch, the soles of his boots swinging back and forth three inches from the ground.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But that was then. Today the Montana legal system is little different from any other state's, and the appeals apparatus in criminal convictions sometimes produces situations with which no one can adequately deal.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The most dangerous, depraved, twisted, and unpredictable human being I ever knew was a rodeo clown by the name of Wyatt Dixon. With my help, he had been sentenced to sixty years in Deer Lodge Pen for murdering a biker in the Aryan Brotherhood. On an early spring morning, one year after Wyatt had begun his sentence in Deer Lodge Pen, I walked from the house down to the road and removed the daily newspaper from the tin cylinder in which it was rolled. I flipped the paper open and began to read the headlines as I walked back up the incline to the house, distracted momentarily by a black bear running out of the sunshine into the spruce trees that grew on the hill immediately behind the house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I glanced back at the paper, I saw Wyatt's name and a wire service story that made me swallow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I sat down at the breakfast table in our kitchen and kept the newspaper folded back upon itself so the story dealing with Wyatt was not visible. Through the side window I could see steam rising from the metal roof on our barn and, farther on, a small herd of elk coming down an arroyo, their hooves pocking the snow that had frozen on the grass during the night.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Why the face?" Temple, my wife, asked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"For spring it's still pretty cold out," I replied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She straightened the tulips in a glass vase on the windowsill and lifted a strand of hair off the glasses she had started wearing. She had thick chestnut hair and the light was shining on it through the window. "Did you say something about Johnny American Horse earlier?" she asked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"He got himself stuck in the can again. I thought I'd go down to morning court," I replied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"He needs a lawyer to get out of the drunk tank?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"This time he had a revolver on him. It was under his coat, so he got booked for carrying a concealed weapon."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Johnny?" she said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I folded the newspaper and stuck it in my coat pocket. "Meet me for lunch?" I said from the doorway.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Can you tell me why you're acting so weird? Why are you taking the newspaper with you?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"No reason."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Right."</p><p></p><p></p><p>The phone rang on the counter. I got to it before she did. "Hello?" I said, my mouth dry.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Well, God bless your little heart, I'd recognize that voice anywhere. Howdy doodie, Mr. Holland? I wasn't sure you was still around, but soon as I come into town, I looked in the phone directory and there was your name in the middle of the page, big as a horse turd floating in a milk shake. Bet you don't know who this is?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"You're making a mistake, partner."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Sir, that injures my feelings. I have called you in good faith and as a fellow American, 'cause this is the land of the free and the home of the brave. I don't hold no grudges. I have even used your name as a reference in the many letters I have wrote to our country's leaders. In fact, I have wrote President Bush himself to offer my services. Has he contacted you yet?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'm going to hang up now. Don't call here again," I said, trying to avoid Temple's stare.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Now listen here, sir, I'm inviting you and your wife to a blowout, all-you-can-eat buffet dinner at the Golden Corral Restaurant. Do not hang up that phone, no-siree-bobtail -- "</p><p></p><p></p><p>I returned the receiver to the cradle. Temple's eyes were riveted on mine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Who was that?" she said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Wyatt Dixon. He's out," I replied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She began to straighten the tulips in the window again but instead knocked over the vase, shattering it in the sink, the tulip petals red as blood among the shards of glass.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As I left the house for work the sun was bright on the hillsides of the valley in which we lived, and to the south I could see the timber climbing up into the snowpack on the crests of the Bitterroots. I turned onto the two-lane into the little town of Lolo, then headed up the road to my office in Missoula. My reluctance to tell Temple that Wyatt Dixon was out of prison had nothing to do with the reasons people normally conceal bad news from their loved ones. Rather, it had everything to do with Temple's own propensity for immediate and violent retaliation against anyone who threatened her person or that of her friends or family.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Back in Texas, before she became a private investigator for small-town lawyers such as myself, she had been a patrolwoman in Dallas, a deputy sheriff in Fort Bend County near Houston, and a corrections officer in Louisiana. She had also been buried alive by Wyatt Dixon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I parked in my rental space not far from the Oxford Bar, whose doors have stayed open since 1891, and walked down the street toward my office close by the courthouse. The maple trees on the courthouse lawn were in new leaf now, riffling in the breeze, the shadows shifting like lacework on the grass. At the corner, across from a pawnshop and bar, I saw a man watching me, his arm hooked on top of a parking meter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He was lantern-jawed, his red hair like cornsilk, his eyes as pale and empty as a desert sky, his teeth big and ...</p></p><h2>Tiffany Taste</h2><p>54 ways to prepare, present, and enjoy the fare in the perfect setting</p><p>Although basically a showcase for Tiffany's lavish products, this volume nonetheless offers enticing, full-page color photographs and diversionary entertainment fantasies.

Known as a performer of Bach, Beethoven, Stravinsky, and Elliott Carter, he has also written highly acclaimed criticism for sophisticated students and professionals. In Piano Notes, he writes for a broader audience about an old friend -- the piano itself. Drawing upon a lifetime of wisdom and the accumulated lore of many great performers of the past, Rosen shows why the instrument demands such a stark combination of mental and physical prowess. Readers will gather many little-known insights -- from how pianists vary their posture, to how splicings and microphone placements can ruin recordings, to how the history of composition was dominated by the piano for two centuries. Stories of many great musicians abound. Rosen reveals Nadia Boulanger&#39;s favorite way to avoid commenting on the performances of her friends (&#34;You know what I think,&#34; spoken with utmost earnestness), why Glenn Gould&#39;s recordings suffer from &#34;double-strike&#34; touches, and how even Vladimir Horowitz became enamored of splicing multiple performances into a single recording. Rosen&#39;s explanation of the piano&#39;s physical pleasures, demands, and discontents will delight and instruct anyone who has ever sat at a keyboard, as well as everyone who loves to listen to the instrument. In the end, he strikes a contemplative note. Western music was built around the piano from the classical era until recently, and for a good part of that time the instrument was an essential acquisition for every middle-class household. Music making was part of the fabric of social life. Yet those days have ended. Fewer people learn the instrument today. The rise of recorded music has homogenized performance styles and greatly reduced the frequency of public concerts. Music will undoubtedly survive, but will the supremely physical experience of playing the piano ever be the same?</p><p><b>Charles Rosen</b> is a distinguished concert pianist and music critic. He has twice been nominated for the Grammy Award, and his landmark book, <i>The Classical Style,</i> won the National Book Award and has been reissued several times. Today he maintains an active performance schedule around the world, as well as writing for <i>The New York Review of Books.</i> He lives in New York City and Paris.<b>Prelude</b> <p> This is a book about the experience of playing the piano. It is not an autobiography, although I have had to draw on some personal anecdotes, but it concerns the experience of playing relevant to all pianists, amateur as well as professional. What has interested me most of all is the relation of the physical act of playing to those aspects of music generally considered more intellectual, spiritual, and emotional, the different ways that body and spirit interact. I have concentrated mostly on professional experience since I know it best, and also because the amateur ideal today is largely derived from the professional standard, but I write for listeners as well as pianists. I have certainly not attempted to tell pianists how they must play. Although my own prejudices have naturally intruded, I have at least tried to keep them under control. There are many valid approaches to the instrument and to its repertoire -- and if I occasionally find some approaches invalid, I am not stiff-necked about them, and not wedded permanently to my opinions. I have been most intent on conveying the variety of experience of playing, its torments and its delights. </p><p> The temptation is great to write inspirational prose in the grand style about an experience as intense as playing is for any committed pianist. I am embarrassed when I read that kind of prose, however, as the intensity of feeling is only made factitious by being diluted with words, so I have largely preferred to let that intensity be taken for granted. I adore the grand style and I am intrigued by grand synthetic theories, but I am suspicious of teachers who claim to have invented the only successful method for bringing out the best in young performers, of theorists who claim to have invented the unique approach to analysis, and of historians who wish to reduce all the developments of the musical style of the past entirely to the determinism of social conditions. Of course, the place of music in society influences the way we listen and play, but there are so many cases when a composer or pianist produces work badly fitted to the conditions of his or her own time but that turns out for some few contemporaries and then for a later period to be of great value. I have also attempted to discuss the constraints that cause pianists to play in ways to which they are not really committed, and have ventured to speculate briefly on the decisive role the instrument has played in both the history of composition and the reception of music today. Above all, I have tried to become more aware myself of the powerful and peculiar motives that drive some of us to the piano instead of to the violin, the guitar, or the record-player, and of the odd difficulties that this decision creates in our lives. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Charles Rosen</p></p><h2>Winterheim (Dragonlance: Icewall Trilogy, Vol. 3)</h2><p>Shrouded in ice, the stronghold of the ogres has stood for eons as an impregnable bastion of the Icereach.

The essays and photographs collected here present art and science in conversation, rather than in opposition. As Gould writes in his preface, although the two disciplines may usually communicate in different dialects, when juxtaposed they strikingly reflect upon and enhance one another. Working together, Purcell's photographs and Gould's scientific musings speak to us about ourselves and our world in a hybrid language richer than either could command on its own. <br><br>In an essay on individuality, for instance, Gould looks through the lens of evolutionary theory to address the controversial issue of cloning and the often misguided fears it evokes. As a society that exalts the concept of the individual, Gould argues, we sometimes fail to recognize that clones walk among us. Identical twins represent "the greatest of all challenges to our concept of individuality." Rosamond Purcell's photograph depicting the famous Siamese conjoined twins Eng and Chang conveys an eerie feeling that cannot be captured in words.<br><br>Through its unique combination of words and photographs, <b>Crossing Over</b> prompts us to ponder not only the basis of the false dichotomy between art and science, but also the distinction of mind and nature, and of all humanly imposed categories of order. Gould and Purcell's work convinces the reader that a provocative interplay between art and science is not only possible, but inevitable and necessary as well.</p><p>Praise for Stephen Jay Gould and Rosamond Purcell<br><br>"Macabre yet serenely beautiful, [the photographs] are like paintings Vermeer might have made after rummaging through a natural-history museum's basement."<br>-- Newsweek, on Finders, Keepers<br><br>"A fascinating combination of art, science, and philosophy."<br>-- Philadelphia Daily News, on Illuminations<br><br>Praise for Stephen Jay Gould<br><br>"Vintage Gould: stimulating, erudite, and eminently enjoyable."<br>-- Kirkus Reviews, on The Lying Stones of Marrakech<br><br>"No one has written of our illusions about progress in nature with more wit<br>and learning than Stephen Jay Gould."<br>-- Oliver Sachs, on Full House<br><br>Praise for Rosamond Purcell<br><br>"Purcell's work brings to mind . . . the boxes of Joseph Cornell, the illustrations of Maurice Sendak, the drawings of Edward Burne-Jones."<br>-- Janet Malcolm, The New Yorker, on A Matter of Time<br><br>"Perceptive thoughts and fabulous photographs of a personal and provocative<br>cabinet of curiosities."<br>Ricky Jay, Vanity Fair, on Special Cases<br>Stephen Jay Gould was one of the most influential evolutionary biologists and most acclaimed science essayists of the 20th century.

Plimpton can make even a negligible life into a magic-carpet ride, as in his editing of Jean Stein's perennial bestseller, <i>Edie</i>, about Andy Warhol's victim-starlet Edie Sedgwick.<p> In <i>Truman Capote</i>, Plimpton has an infinitely more important subject, who worked his way down from the top into the shallow pit of druggy celebrity. His book doesn't knock the definitive biography <i>Capote</i> off the shelf, but it's much more fun to read. Plimpton interviewed more than a hundred people--from Capote's childhood to his peak period, 1966, when his Black and White Ball defined high society and <i>In Cold Blood</i> launched the true crime genre, all the way down to his last, sad days as a bitchy caricature of himself. Joanna Carson complains that Plimpton's book is "gossip," which it gloriously is. But it's also brimming with important literary history, and it helps in the Herculean task of sorting out the truth from Capote's multitudinous, entertaining lies; for instance, <i>In Cold Blood</i> turns out to be not strictly factual. James Dickey, whose similar self-destruction is chronicled in <i>Summer of Deliverance</i>, delivers here a good definition of Capote's true gift to literature: "The scene stirring with rightness and strangeness, the compressed phrase, the exact yet imaginative word, the devastating metaphorical aptness, a feeling of concentrated excess which at the same time gives the effect of being crystalline." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>He was the most social of writers, and at the height of his career he was the point where the glamorous worlds of the arts, society and politics all met--a status perhaps best exemplified by his still legendary Black and White Ball.

BOMC Main. QPB Alt.</p><p>This richly illustrated book brings together 14 essays by such luminaries as former Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving and art historian Robert Rosenblum, and finally and firmly anchors Rockwell's reputation in the art-historical world. The catalog of an exhibition at Atlanta's High Museum of Art, the book's 133 color reproductions are marvelously large, clear, and true in color and offer what is probably the best introduction to Rockwell for anyone who takes his illustration seriously--or anyone who doesn't, yet. Indispensable though it may be, however, <i>Pictures for the American People</i> may slightly irritate lifelong Rockwell fans, especially those who grew up with the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> and fell for Rockwell at a time when his nonpareil illustrations were mocked by the moderns. And experienced Rockwell lovers probably have on their shelves the huge 1970 work by Thomas S. Buechner, then director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, <i>Norman Rockwell: Artist and Illustrator</i>, which was the first comprehensive look at this uniquely American master. <p> Ah, well. It's about time the art world came to its senses and began to appreciate the genius and the subtlety of a painter who looked to both Chardin and N.C. Wyeth as masters. Rockwell's great works are here: <i>Rosie the Riveter</i>, <i>The Four Freedoms</i>, <i>After the Prom</i>, <i>Breaking Home Ties</i>, <i>The Gossips</i>, and scores of others that celebrate (and poke the gentlest of fun at) small-town, family life. There were other illustrators of Rockwell's ilk during the '40s and '50s, his most popular decades, but as Steven Heller writes in "Rebelling Against Rockwell," "Rockwell ran one step ahead of clich�, while his acolytes lagged a mile behind." <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>Publicity: 1-hour television special on Norman Rockwell to air on public television this fall Promotion: Featured in Abrams&#39; 50th-anniversary celebration Subsidiary Rights:A Main Selection of Book-of-the-Month Club and an Alternate Selection of Quality Paperback Book Club Maureen Hart Hennessey is chief curator at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

Smart, funny, evocative, and suspenseful, <em>The Laughter of Dead Kings</em> is a fond and fitting farewell to the ever-delightful Vicky...and a superior mystery fit for a King Tutankhamen.</p><p><p>For the first time in more than a decade, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Grand Master Elizabeth Peters brings beautiful, brainy Vicky Bliss back into the spotlight for one last investigation. But this time the peerless art historian and sleuth will be detecting in Amelia Peabody territory, searching for solutions to more than one heinous offense in the ever-shifting sands of Egypt's mysterious Valley of the Kings.</p><p>Who stole one of Egypt's most priceless treasures? That is the question that haunts the authorities after a distinguished British gentleman with an upper-crust accent cons his way past a security guard and escapes into the desert carrying a world-famous, one-of-a-kind historic relic. But the Egyptian authorities and Interpol believe they know the identity of the culprit. The brazen crime bears all the earmarks of the work of one &#x201c;Sir John Smythe,&#x201d; the suave and dangerously charming international art thief who is, in fact, John Tregarth, the longtime significant other of Vicky Bliss. But John swears he is retired&#x2014;not to mention innocent&#x2014;and he vows to clear his name by hunting down the true criminal.</p><p>Vicky's faith in her man's integrity leaves her no choice but to take a hiatus from her position at a leading Munich museum and set out for the Middle East. Vicky's employer, the eminent Herr Doktor Anton Z. Schmidt, rotund gourmand and insatiable adventurer, decides to join the entourage.</p><p>But dark days and myriad dangers await them in this land of intriguing antiquity. Each uncovered clue seems to raise even more questions for the intrepid Vicky&#x2014;the most troubling being, Where is John going during his increasingly frequent and unexplained absences? And the stakes are elevated considerably when a ransom note arrives accompanied by a grisly memento intended to speed up negotiations&#x2014;because now it appears that murder most foul has been added to the equation.</p><p>Elizabeth Peters earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago&#x2019;s famed Oriental Institute. During her fifty-year career, she wrote more than seventy novels and three nonfiction books on Egypt. She received numerous writing awards and, in 2012, was given the first Amelia Peabody Award, created in her honor. She died in 2013, leaving a partially completed manuscript of <em>The Painted Queen</em>. </p></p><h2>Wetland, Woodland, Wildland: A Guide to the Natural Communities of Vermont (Middlebury Bicentennial Series in Environmental Studies)</h2><p>Vermont&#39;s natural communities -- its northern hardwood forests, dry oak woodlands, alpine tundra, red maple swamps, bogs, and marshes -- are described in this comprehensive book.

Now, she tackles an issue every woman deals with: body image and self-acceptance.</b><br><br>Emerson, Georgia, and Marley have been best friends ever since they met at a weight-loss camp as teens. When Emerson tragically passes away, she leaves one final wish for her best friends: to conquer the fears they still carry as adults. <br><br>For each of them, that means something different. For Marley, it's coming to terms with the survivor's guilt she's carried around since her twin sister's death, which has left her blind to the real chance for romance in her life. For Georgia, it's about learning to stop trying to live up to her mother's and brother's ridiculous standards, and learning to accept the love her ex-husband has tried to give her. <br><br>But as Marley and Georgia grow stronger, the real meaning of Emerson's dying wish becomes truly clear: more than anything, she wanted her friends to love themselves. <br><br>A novel of compassion and insight, <i>Good Luck With That</i> tells the story of two women who learn to embrace themselves just the way they are.</p><p><b>Kristan Higgins</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today </i>bestselling author of nearly twenty novels, which have been translated into more than two dozen languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide.

So far, our record was five words in a row, which was pretty good, given that everyone here was only four and had the attention span of a gnat.</p><p>&#x201c;Theater,&#x201d; said Silvi.</p><p>Lissie, my assistant teacher, shot me a glance. Silvi was advanced, already reading. I felt a flash of pride for Clara, followed by the increasingly familiar buzz of nerves whenever anything related to Rafael entered my consciousness. For nearly five years, I&#x2019;d done a damn good job of keeping him out of my head.</p><p>&#x201c;Turd,&#x201d; said Geronimo, and the kids dissolved into giggles.</p><p>&#x201c;He said &#x2018;turd&#x2019;! He said &#x2018;turd&#x2019;! Turd!&#x201d; they shrieked. Axel got up and ran in a circle, a victory lap of sorts. Khaleesi started to cry, since she hated all things bowel-related, and Lissie comforted her.</p><p>&#x201c;We got up to six &#x2018;T&#x2019; words! That&#x2019;s a new record, so good work,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And, Geronimo, you&#x2019;re very funny, but let&#x2019;s keep bathroom talk for bathrooms and when you have to go, okay, sweetheart?&#x201d; I glanced at the clock. &#x201c;Great job, everyone. And look at the clock! It&#x2019;s time to clean up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up,&#x201d; the kids sang. We had a song for everything.</p><p>I directed the kids&#x2014;Khaleesi and Cash could put the stuffed animals away, Silvi and Wren could bring the paintbrushes to the sink, Dash and Roland would put pink reminder slips in everyone&#x2019;s cubby about bringing in special cuddle friends on Friday. Nash and Primrose reshelved books. I helped kids find their lunch boxes, gave out hugs, checked to see if paintings were dry enough to be taken home.</p><p>Then, at 2:00 on the dot, Lissie opened the door to let the parents in to get their kids. Donna, the teacher in room 2, let her kids out early every day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was one year away from retirement and really over teaching. The hallway was mobbed with kids and parents, and for a second, I didn&#x2019;t see him.</p><p>Then Silvi shouted, &#x201c;Uncle Rafe!&#x201d; and he knelt down, opening his arms as she ran to him.</p><p>My body reacted before my brain&#x2014;knees softened, my left leg wobbling, the instant heat in my stomach rising through my chest and neck into my face, my hands buzzing with adrenaline.</p><p>He was here.</p><p>Clara had put him on the authorized-pickup list. I&#x2019;d known this day was coming, but now that it was upon me, I couldn&#x2019;t seem to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was the question again?</p><p>Rafe picked up his niece, kissed her on the cheek. &#x201c;Hello, sweet girl,&#x201d; he said, smiling.</p><p>Then he looked at me, and his eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I couldn&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;d gone so long without seeing those eyes, so dark and beautiful, either the happiest or saddest eyes in the entire world, depending on his mood.</p><p>They were happy right now. Because of Silvi, of course.</p><p>He was clean-shaven now, and it made him look younger. My heart felt weak and thin.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia,&#x201d; he said, and my stomach squeezed. His accent always made my name sound lush and delicious.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Rafe,&#x201d; I managed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>He was more beautiful than ever. Every one of his features was just a little big&#x2014;nose, mouth, eyes. Generous. His hair was shorter. No more ponytail, and he looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perfect. But for some reason, his short hair and lack of a beard made me want to cry a little, because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, because I hadn&#x2019;t known.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Georgia, Miss Georgia, I can&#x2019;t find my sock!&#x201d; said Geronimo, who liked to strip down naked in the bathroom. And thank God, because it gave me an excuse to stop staring at my ex. I took Geronimo by the hand and led him to the bathroom, my heart banging. Never in my life was I so glad to close a door.</p><p>I took in a breath, then picked up the errant sock, which was lying under the sink. &#x201c;Here you go, honey. Remember what we said about keeping your clothes on in here? Just pull down your pants next time, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. I love you,&#x201d; he said, throwing his arms around my neck.</p><p>Maybe if I&#x2019;d been a preschool teacher when Rafe and I were married, we would&#x2019;ve made it.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t start, my brain said. You blew it. He asked for a divorce and you couldn&#x2019;t say yes fast enough.</p><p>I put on Geronimo&#x2019;s sock, tied his shoes and had him wash his hands. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my boy,&#x201d; I said, ruffling his hair.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re best friends,&#x201d; he told me.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to have so many best friends, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I asked. Couldn&#x2019;t have him thinking he was my favorite, even if he was in my top five.</p><p>When I came out, Geronimo&#x2019;s dad was waiting. &#x201c;How was my boy today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was excellent, as usual,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And very creative.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said &#x2018;turd,&#x2019; Daddy! It starts with &#x2018;T&#x2019;!&#x201d;</p><p>The dad laughed. &#x201c;I guess it does. Thanks, Georgia. See you tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bye, gentlemen. Have a great afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>Silvi was giving her uncle the tour. &#x201c;This is where we paint. This is where we read books. I have this book at home. I have this one, too. Read me this one, Uncle Rafe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi, let me talk to Miss Georgia a moment, sweetheart. We are old friends, did you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>My heart rate tripled.</p><p>&#x201c;You are?&#x201d; Silvi asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a pleasant surprise!&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help a smile. Silvi&#x2019;s vocabulary was rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.</p><p>&#x201c;We are.&#x201d; His hand rested on her head. &#x201c;Can you look at a book by yourself for a moment, sweet one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi loves books, don&#x2019;t you, honey?&#x201d; Which he probably knew, being her uncle and all that.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I do,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can read some by myself.&#x201d;</p><p>My hands were shaking, so I stuck them in the pockets of my denim jumper (which was just as sexy as it sounded).</p><p>Rafe came over and stood in front of me, and my heart wasn&#x2019;t just pounding now, but thrumming. The poker in my stomach twisted again and again.</p><p>&#x201c;Small world,&#x201d; I said, my voice quiet.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. How have you been, Georgia?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great. Fine. I&#x2019;m preschool teacher now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I heard.&#x201d; A dark eyebrow lifted.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you have a new restaurant. Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cherish told me. My stepmother? Remember her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I remember her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Why wouldn&#x2019;t you? I mean, how many people are named Cherish, right? Let alone exotic dancer stepmoms, right? Anyway, she said that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that she went to your restaurant. And it was good.&#x201d;</p><p>Rafe didn&#x2019;t answer for a minute. Why would he? I was babbling like an idiot. I tried to look at him and failed.</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi says she loves school,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;Thank you for that. The move, it was a little difficult for her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s doing great here.&#x201d; I drew in a shaky breath. &#x201c;How are you, Rafael?&#x201d; Forced myself to look at him.</p><p>His expression was neutral. I had no idea what mine was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing very well, thank you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope it will not be too awkward, us seeing each other from time to time.&#x201d;</p><p>Awkward? Not at all. Agonizing, that was a better word.</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s fine. Don&#x2019;t worry about me! I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m great. With this, I mean. It&#x2019;s lovely to see you again. Lovely to have Silvi. That&#x2019;s what I meant.&#x201d;</p><p>He just kept looking at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you seeing anyone?&#x201d; I asked, then jerked back a little because I hadn&#x2019;t meant to ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course he was. &#x201c;And is she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is she nice?&#x201d; Is she beautiful? Is she kind? Is she thin? Do you love her?</p><p>My ex-husband didn&#x2019;t answer immediately. The silence swelled. Then he said, &#x201c;I would rather not discuss her. But yes. She is nice.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded, my face burning. &#x201c;Well. Congratulations on the new restaurant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uncle Rafe?&#x201d;</p><p>This time, the voice was deeper. We both turned, and there was Mason.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Rafe said, his eyes widening in surprise. &#x201c;It cannot be. Mason? Oh, madre de Dios, Mason! Where is the boy? You are a young man now! Come! Give me a hug!&#x201d;</p><p>There it was, that magical ease and warmth he had with people. Mason obeyed happily, and I swallowed against the wedge in my throat.</p><p>Mason had been our ring bearer.</p><p>The two of them were chatting away like long-lost friends, which I guessed they were.</p><p>That was the shitty thing about divorce. You lost that whole other family, that whole world. Rafe had been so good for Mason, his gentle brand of masculinity a much better role model than Hunter&#x2019;s seething, omnipresent hostility.</p><p>Maybe if Rafe had been in the picture, Mason wouldn&#x2019;t have done what he did this past April.</p><p>&#x201c;Mason, please, come meet my niece, Silvi. She is a student here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cool. Hey, little kid. I&#x2019;m Mason.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not little. I&#x2019;m almost a big sister,&#x201d; Silvi said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, gotcha. Sorry.&#x201d; Mason grinned at us.</p><p>&#x201c;I forgive you,&#x201d; she said sweetly.</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi, we should go,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;I have to work tonight, and I want to take you to the park and perhaps for some ice cream, what do you say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I say yes!&#x201d; Silvi got up, hugged my legs, then grabbed her uncle&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Bye, Miss Georgia,&#x201d; she sang out.</p><p>&#x201c;It was good to see you,&#x201d; Rafe said. Probably a lie.</p><p>Then they were gone.</p></p><h2>Almost Nearly Perfect People</h2><p>Almost Nearly Perfect People<br>The Danes are the happiest people in the world, and pay the highest taxes.'Neutral' Sweden is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world.Finns have the largest per capita gun ownership after the US and Yemen.54 per cent of Icelanders believe in elves.Norway is the richest country on earth.5 per cent of Danish men have had sex with an animal.Michael Booth has lived among the Scandinavians, on and off, for over ten years, perplexed by their many strange paradoxes and character traits and equally bemused by the unquestioning enthusiasm for all things Nordic and hygge that has engulfed the rest of the world.

This volume collects four different story lines (each encompassing two issues) involving the Earth-One Justice League of America (the most familiar DC stars such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman) and the Earth-Two Justice Society of America (older heroes, some with Earth-One counterparts such as the Flash and Green Lantern, but some unique heroes such as Doctor Fate and Hourman), all from the mid-'60s and written by Gardner Fox with pencils by Mike Sekowsky. The best story introduces Earth-Three, where only criminals have the super powers. Bored with committing easy crimes, the Crime Syndicate of America--a band of supervillains with knockoff costumes and dumb names ("Power Ring," "Johnny Quick")--challenges the JLA and JSA to battle. The other stories involve the Crime Champions of Earth-One and -Two, Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt, and Solomon Grundy and Blockbuster. For more crossover action, <i>Crisis on Multiple Earths</i> was followed by a volume 2. Alex Ross did the cover paintings for all three <i>Crisis...</i> books. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Gardner Fox is the industry-legend creator of The Flash, Hawkman, Dr. Mid-Nite, (the original) Starman and Adam Strange, and also worked extensively on JLA and Batman - as well as writing over 100 novels!

In &#34;Miss Mackenzie&#34;, Trollope made a deliberate attempt &#34;to prove that a novel may be produced without love&#34;, by choosing as his heroine an unattractive, middle-aged woman, but as he admits in his autobiography, even in &#34;this attempt it breaks down before the conclusion&#34; and she was in love by the end of the book and made a romantic marriage. At the same time, Trollope also gives a comic portrait of evangelical society in a provincial watering-place. The editor, A.O.J. Cockshut is author of &#34;Truth to life&#34; and &#34;Art of autobiography&#34; as well as studies of Trollope, Dickens and Scott, and the chronology is by John Halperin.</p><p>As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841.

Major ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Third life of Gleason in recent months and by far the best--as well as one of the best celebrity bios of recent memory, written with richness and brio by two-time Pulitzer-winner (for journalism) Henry (Visions of America, 1985), who's also a culture critic for Time. Deeply researched and taking nothing for granted, here's a book that gives us a Gleason whose warts match his ego, a man whose imagination was ever hog-wild on alcohol and, as with many active drinkers, whose better nature was often drowned by mean- spiritedness. Henry's Gleason, contrary to the legendary Gleason of thousands of interviews and news stories, is an utterly private, self-enclosed man fearful of revealing his deep-seated insecurities and blackly depressing childhood. He would always move back his mother Mae's death by three years when talking of it, having her die when he was a Dickensian waif of 16 rather than an earning entertainer of 19. His father had abandoned the family during the Depression, and his brother had died when Gleason was a child, leaving the future comedian overprotected by Mae. Despite his freewheeling, big-handed way with money and his many gifts to friends and strangers, Gleason apparently used money to bolster his power over CBS and did not think twice about cruelly uprooting some New York subordinates and replanting them in Florida so he could refine his golf game while producing a new version of his TV show. His famed musical genius and so-called conducting skills evidently were zilch, although his mood-music recordings made zillions. Typically, Henry points out, his buddyship with fellow farceur Art Carney was invented for the papers and did not exist. Though Gleason's extravagances were bottle dreams made real, he died of cancer and not from the drink, gluttony, and chain-smoking that should have killed him. A deep-delving bio for Gleason-lovers. (Twenty-four b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Following W. J. Weatherby's disappointing Jackie Gleason (Nonfiction Forecasts, Mar. 9), this is a thorough, penetrating, uncompromising study of the Brooklyn-born, Irish-American ghetto kid whose talents took him to the top. The cultural icon's programs dominated TV in the 1950s, and even today reruns of The Honeymooners wipe out the competition, notes Time magazine culture critic Henry, who expertly analyzes the performer's acting on TV, on stage and in film. Although known as "The Great One," so dubbed by Orson Welles, Gleason (1916-1987), shows the author, was a terror in his private life: a glutton, heavy drinker and womanizer who was cruel to friends and associates. The book presents diverse sentiments from those who knew him well, suggesting that he presented many different guises. Or, as a close friend quoted here concludes: "The truth is, I don't know if I ever met Jack Gleason. I know I met some portrayal of him."

Acclaimed as a classic, it was a travel book like no other. Quirky, discursive, endlessly curious, Heat-Moon had embarked on an American journey off the beaten path. Sticking to the small places via the small roads--those colored blue on maps--he uncovered a nation deep in character, story, and charm. <br>Now, for the first time since <i>Blue Highways</i>, Heat-Moon is back on the backroads. ROADS TO QUOZ is his lyrical, funny, and touching account of a series of American journeys into small-town America.</p><p>William Least Heat-Moon is the author of the bestselling classics <em>Roads to Quoz</em>, <i>Blue Highways, River Horse, </i>and <i>PrairyEarth.</i> He lives in Columbia, Missouri.If you&#39;re in a hurry to get somewhere, use the expressway. But if you have time to meander and marvel at things along the way, use America&#39;s blue highways, the small roads that allow such reflection. William Least Heat-Moon introduced America to the BLUE HIGHWAYS 25 years ago, and now he&#39;s back with ROADS TO QUOZ, a ramble through wonderful and mysterious places that most Americans never see from the superhighways. Narrator Sherman Howard perfectly delivers the author&#39;s saunter through the states. Howard&#39;s untroubled, unhurried exposition allows the listener to bask in the splendid (sometimes overdone) descriptions of &#34;all things Quoz--things strange, incongruous, or peculiar.&#34; Howard delights in telling us about the mysterious Quapaw Ghost Light of Oklahoma or southern river towns that time forgot. It&#39;s like sitting on Grandpa&#39;s knee or hearing the ghost of Charles Kuralt exulting in all the wonderful tiny things that make up the fabric of America.

A pregnancy scare. Two cheating scandals. And that&#x2019;s just this week&#x2019;s update. If all you knew of Bayview High was Simon Kelleher&#x2019;s gossip app, you&#x2019;d wonder how anyone found time to go to class.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Old news, Bronwyn,&#x201d; says a voice over my shoulder. &#x201c;Wait till you see tomorrow&#x2019;s post.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Damn. I hate getting caught reading About That, especially by its creator. I lower my phone and slam my locker shut. &#x201c;Whose lives are you ruining next, Simon?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon falls into step beside me as I move against the flow of students heading for the exit. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a public service,&#x201d; he says with a dismissive wave. &#x201c;You tutor Reggie Crawley, don&#x2019;t you? Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather know he has a camera in his bedroom?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t bother answering. Me getting anywhere near the bedroom of perpetual stoner Reggie Crawley is about as likely as Simon growing a conscience.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anyway, they bring it on themselves. If people didn&#x2019;t lie and cheat, I&#x2019;d be out of business.&#x201d; Simon&#x2019;s cold blue eyes take in my lengthening strides. &#x201c;Where are you rushing off to? Covering yourself in extracurricular glory?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I wish. As if to taunt me, an alert crosses my phone: Mathlete practice, 3 p.m., Epoch Coffee. Followed by a text from one of my teammates: Evan&#x2019;s here.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course he is. The cute Mathlete--less of an oxymoron than you might think--seems to only ever show up when I can&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; I say. As a general rule, and especially lately, I try to give Simon as little information as possible. We push through green metal doors to the back stairwell, a dividing line between the dinginess of the original Bayview High and its bright, airy new wing. Every year more wealthy families get priced out of San Diego and come fifteen miles east to Bayview, expecting that their tax dollars will buy them a nicer school experience than popcorn ceilings and scarred linoleum.<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon&#x2019;s still on my heels when I reach Mr. Avery&#x2019;s lab on the third floor, and I half turn with my arms crossed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have someplace to be?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah. Detention,&#x201d; Simon says, and waits for me to keep walking. When I grasp the knob instead, he bursts out laughing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding me. You too? What&#x2019;s your crime?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m wrongfully accused,&#x201d; I mutter, and yank the door open. Three other students are already seated, and I pause to take them in. Not the group I would have predicted. Except one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nate Macauley tips his chair back and smirks at me. &#x201c;You make a wrong turn? This is detention, not student council.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He should know. Nate&#x2019;s been in trouble since fifth grade, which is right around the time we last spoke. The gossip mill tells me he&#x2019;s on probation with Bayview&#x2019;s finest for . . . something. It might be a DUI; it might be drug dealing. He&#x2019;s a notorious supplier, but my knowledge is purely theoretical.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Save the commentary.&#x201d; Mr. Avery checks something off on a clipboard and closes the door behind Simon. High arched windows lining the back wall send triangles of afternoon sun splashing across the floor, and faint sounds of football practice float from the field behind the parking lot below.<br> &nbsp;<br> I take a seat as Cooper Clay, who&#x2019;s palming a crumpled piece of paper like a baseball, whispers &#x201c;Heads up, Addy&#x201d; and tosses it toward the girl across from him. Addy Prentiss blinks, smiles uncertainly, and lets the ball drop to the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> The classroom clock inches toward three, and I follow its progress with a helpless feeling of injustice. I shouldn&#x2019;t even be here. I should be at Epoch Coffee, flirting awkwardly with Evan Neiman over differential equations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Avery is a give-detention-first, ask-questions-never kind of guy, but maybe there&#x2019;s still time to change his mind. I clear my throat and start to raise my hand until I notice Nate&#x2019;s smirk broadening. &#x201c;Mr. Avery, that wasn&#x2019;t my phone you found. I don&#x2019;t know how it got into my bag. This is mine,&#x201d; I say, brandishing my iPhone in its melon-striped case.<br> &nbsp;<br> Honestly, you&#x2019;d have to be clueless to bring a phone to Mr. Avery&#x2019;s lab. He has a strict no-phone policy and spends the first ten minutes of every class rooting through backpacks like he&#x2019;s head of airline security and we&#x2019;re all on the watch list. My phone was in my locker, like always.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You too?&#x201d; Addy turns to me so quickly, her blond shampoo-ad hair swirls around her shoulders. She must have been surgically removed from her boyfriend in order to show up alone. &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t my phone either.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me three,&#x201d; Cooper chimes in. His Southern accent makes it sound like thray. He and Addy exchange surprised looks, and I wonder how this is news to them when they&#x2019;re part of the same clique. Maybe �berpopular people have better things to talk about than unfair detentions.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Somebody punked us!&#x201d; Simon leans forward with his elbows on the desk, looking spring-loaded and ready to pounce on fresh gossip. His gaze darts over all four of us, clustered in the middle of the otherwise empty classroom, before settling on Nate. &#x201c;Why would anybody want to trap a bunch of students with mostly spotless records in detention? Seems like the sort of thing that, oh, I don&#x2019;t know, a guy who&#x2019;s here all the time might do for fun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I look at Nate, but can&#x2019;t picture it. Rigging detention sounds like work, and everything about Nate--from his messy dark hair to his ratty leather jacket--screams Can&#x2019;t be bothered. Or yawns it, maybe. He meets my eyes but doesn&#x2019;t say a word, just tips his chair back even farther. Another millimeter and he&#x2019;ll fall right over.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cooper sits up straighter, a frown crossing his Captain America face. &#x201c;Hang on. I thought this was just a mix-up, but if the same thing happened to all of us, it&#x2019;s somebody&#x2019;s stupid idea of a prank. And I&#x2019;m missing baseball practice because of it.&#x201d; He says it like he&#x2019;s a heart surgeon being detained from a lifesaving operation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Avery rolls his eyes. &#x201c;Save the conspiracy theories for another teacher. I&#x2019;m not buying it. You all know the rules against bringing phones to class, and you broke them.&#x201d; He gives Simon an especially sour glance. Teachers know About That exists, but there&#x2019;s not much they can do to stop it. Simon only uses initials to identify people and never talks openly about school. &#x201c;Now listen up. You&#x2019;re here until four. I want each of you to write a five-hundred-word essay on how technology is ruining American high schools. Anyone who can&#x2019;t follow the rules gets another detention tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do we write with?&#x201d; Addy asks. &#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any computers here.&#x201d; Most classrooms have Chromebooks, but Mr. Avery, who looks like he should have retired a decade ago, is a holdout.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Avery crosses to Addy&#x2019;s desk and taps the corner of a lined yellow notepad. We all have one. &#x201c;Explore the magic of longhand writing. It&#x2019;s a lost art.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addy&#x2019;s pretty, heart-shaped face is a mask of confusion. &#x201c;But how do we know when we&#x2019;ve reached five hundred words?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Count,&#x201d; Mr. Avery replies. His eyes drop to the phone I&#x2019;m still holding. &#x201c;And hand that over, Miss Rojas.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t the fact that you&#x2019;re confiscating my phone twice give you pause? Who has two phones?&#x201d; I ask. Nate grins, so quick I almost miss it. &#x201c;Seriously, Mr. Avery, somebody was playing a joke on us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Avery&#x2019;s snowy mustache twitches in annoyance, and he extends his hand with a beckoning motion. &#x201c;Phone, Miss Rojas. Unless you want a return visit.&#x201d; I give it over with a sigh as he looks disapprovingly at the others. &#x201c;The phones I took from the rest of you earlier are in my desk. You&#x2019;ll get them back after detention.&#x201d; Addy and Cooper exchange amused glances, probably because their actual phones are safe in their backpacks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Avery tosses my phone into a drawer and sits behind the teacher&#x2019;s desk, opening a book as he prepares to ignore us for the next hour. I pull out a pen, tap it against my yellow notepad, and contemplate the assignment. Does Mr. Avery really believe technology is ruining schools? That&#x2019;s a pretty sweeping statement to make over a few contraband phones. Maybe it&#x2019;s a trap and he&#x2019;s looking for us to contradict him instead of agree.<br> &nbsp;<br> I glance at Nate, who&#x2019;s bent over his notepad writing computers suck over and over in block letters.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s possible I&#x2019;m overthinking this.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cooper<br> &nbsp;<br> Monday, September 24, 3:05 p.m.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> My hand hurts within minutes. It&#x2019;s pathetic, I guess, but I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I wrote anything longhand. Plus I&#x2019;m using my right hand, which never feels natural no matter how many years I&#x2019;ve done it. My father insisted I learn to write right-handed in second grade after he first saw me pitch. Your left arm&#x2019;s gold, he told me. Don&#x2019;t waste it on crap that don&#x2019;t matter. Which is anything but pitching as far as he&#x2019;s concerned.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was when he started calling me Cooperstown, like the baseball hall of fame. Nothing like putting a little pressure on an eight-year-old.<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon reaches for his backpack and roots around, unzipping every section. He hoists it onto his lap and peers inside. &#x201c;Where the hell&#x2019;s my water bottle?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No talking, Mr. Kelleher,&#x201d; Mr. Avery says without looking up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know, but--my water bottle&#x2019;s missing. And I&#x2019;m thirsty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Avery points toward the sink at the back of the room, its counter crowded with beakers and petri dishes. &#x201c;Get yourself a drink. Quietly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon gets up and grabs a cup from a stack on the counter, filling it with water from the tap. He heads back to his seat and puts the cup on his desk, but seems distracted by Nate&#x2019;s methodical writing. &#x201c;Dude,&#x201d; he says, kicking his sneaker against the leg of Nate&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Seriously. Did you put those phones in our backpacks to mess with us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Mr. Avery looks up, frowning. &#x201c;I said quietly, Mr. Kelleher.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nate leans back and crosses his arms. &#x201c;Why would I do that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon shrugs. &#x201c;Why do you do anything? So you&#x2019;ll have company for whatever your screw-up of the day was?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One more word out of either of you and it&#x2019;s detention tomorrow,&#x201d; Mr. Avery warns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon opens his mouth anyway, but before he can speak there&#x2019;s the sound of tires squealing and then the crash of two cars hitting each other. Addy gasps and I brace myself against my desk like somebody just rear-ended me. Nate, who looks glad for the interruption, is the first on his feet toward the window. &#x201c;Who gets into a fender bender in the school parking lot?&#x201d; he asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bronwyn looks at Mr. Avery like she&#x2019;s asking for permission, and when he gets up from his desk she heads for the window as well. Addy follows her, and I finally unfold myself from my seat. Might as well see what&#x2019;s going on. I lean against the ledge to look outside, and Simon comes up beside me with a disparaging laugh as he surveys the scene below.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two cars, an old red one and a nondescript gray one, are smashed into each other at a right angle. We all stare at them in silence until Mr. Avery lets out an exasperated sigh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better make sure no one was hurt.&#x201d; He runs his eyes over all of us and zeroes in on Bronwyn as the most responsible of the bunch. &#x201c;Miss Rojas, keep this room contained until I get back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Bronwyn says, casting a nervous glance toward Nate. We stay at the window, watching the scene below, but before Mr. Avery or another teacher appears outside, both cars start their engines and drive out of the parking lot.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, that was anticlimactic,&#x201d; Simon says. He heads back to his desk and picks up his cup, but instead of sitting he wanders to the front of the room and scans the periodic table of elements poster. He leans out into the hallway like he&#x2019;s about to leave, but then he turns and raises his cup like he&#x2019;s toasting us. &#x201c;Anyone else want some water?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do,&#x201d; Addy says, slipping into her chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get it yourself, princess.&#x201d; Simon smirks. Addy rolls her eyes and stays put while Simon leans against Mr. Avery&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Literally, huh? What&#x2019;ll you do with yourself now that homecoming&#x2019;s over? Big gap between now and senior prom.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Addy looks at me without answering. I don&#x2019;t blame her. �Simon&#x2019;s train of thought almost never goes anywhere good when it comes to our friends. He acts like he&#x2019;s above caring whether he&#x2019;s popular, but he was pretty smug when he wound up on the junior prom court last spring. I&#x2019;m still not sure how he pulled that off, unless he traded keeping secrets for votes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon was nowhere to be found on homecoming court last week, though. I was voted king, so maybe I&#x2019;m next on his list to harass, or whatever the hell he&#x2019;s doing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your point, Simon?&#x201d; I ask, taking a seat next to Addy. Addy and I aren&#x2019;t close, exactly, but I kind of feel protective of her. She&#x2019;s been dating my best friend since freshman year, and she&#x2019;s a sweet girl. Also not the kind of person who knows how to stand up to a guy like Simon who just won&#x2019;t quit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a princess and you&#x2019;re a jock,&#x201d; he says. He thrusts his chin toward Bronwyn, then at Nate. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re a brain. And you&#x2019;re a criminal. You&#x2019;re all walking teen-movie stereotypes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about you?&#x201d; Bronwyn asks. She&#x2019;s been hovering near the window, but now goes to her desk and perches on top of it. She crosses her legs and pulls her dark ponytail over one shoulder. Something about her is cuter this year. New glasses, maybe? Longer hair? All of a sudden, she&#x2019;s kind of working this sexy-nerd thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the omniscient narrator,&#x201d; Simon says.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bronwyn&#x2019;s brows rise above her black frames. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing in teen movies.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, but Bronwyn.&#x201d; Simon winks and chugs his water in one long gulp. &#x201c;There is such a thing in life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He says it like a threat, and I wonder if he&#x2019;s got something on Bronwyn for that stupid app of his. I hate that thing. Almost all my friends have been on it at one point or another, and sometimes it causes real problems. My buddy Luis and his girlfriend broke up because of something Simon wrote. Though it was a true story about Luis hooking up with his girlfriend&#x2019;s cousin. But still. That stuff doesn&#x2019;t have to be published. Hallway gossip is bad enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> And if I&#x2019;m being honest, I&#x2019;m pretty freaked at what Simon could write about me if he put his mind to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon holds his cup up, grimacing. &#x201c;This tastes like crap.&#x201d; He drops the cup, and I roll my eyes at his attempt at drama. Even when he falls to the floor, I still think he&#x2019;s messing around. But then the wheezing starts.</p><h2>A Double Affair</h2><p>The characteristically charming 1957 installment in Angela Thirkell&#39;s beloved series of Barsetshire novels, picks up where its predecessor, NEVER TOO LATE, leaves off.

The community is all abuzz with news of the impending marriage of Herbert Choyce (vicar of Hatch End) and Miss Merriman (who had been the long-time secretary of the late Lady Emily Graham and was affectionately known as 'Merry'). The couple, older and wiser than the usual betrothed, are in no hurry to tie the marital knot, but the enthusiasm of their friends and neighbors sweeps them up in a rush to the altar, as all of Barsetshire's familiar faces join in the festivities. In the wake of the wedding, other concerns take center stage. The older generation comes together in friendship, while the younger sets off on exciting and romantic adventures, as life and love go on in the pleasant precincts of Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire. </p>Angela Thirkell was born in London in 1890. Mrs. Thirkell did not begin writing novels until her return to Britain in 1930; then, for the rest of her life, she produced a new book almost every year until her death in 1961.</p><h2>End in Tears: A Wexford Novel (Chief Inspector Wexford Mysteries)</h2><p>At first there was no reason to link the killings. The first one, months earlier, seemed totally random: a lump of concrete pushed off an overpass onto a passing car. By contrast, the gruesome bludgeoning death of Amber Marshalson, returning home late from a night out clubbing with friends, was obviously calculated. The killer had been seen waiting for the girl in a nearby wood. But when Chief Inspector Wexford discovers that Amber had been the driver right behind the crushed car&#x2014;and that she&#x2019;d been driving a silver Honda, while the car in front of her was a gray Honda&#x2014;he knows that someone wanted the teenager dead badly enough to kill twice to get the job done. And as it turns out, this murderer&#x2019;s plans are only just getting underway. Can Wexford unravel the complex knots that connect these murders in time to save future victims? Or is he, as he begins to fear, losing his touch and fast becoming a relic of another time?<br><br>Long beloved by readers for her deft weaving of wonderfully meticulous characterization, dark humor, and trenchant social commentary into gripping and fast-paced plots, Ruth Rendell is in top form with <i>End in Tears</i>. Taking off from the first page with back-to-back murders and ending with one of Wexford&#x2019;s own officers in mortal danger, <i>End in Tears</i> touches on issues of class, race, parenthood, aging, and gender roles as it brings the traditional British whodunit into the twenty-first century.<br><br>Also available as a Random House AudioBook, Large Print edition, and eBook</p><p>Ruth Rendell is the author of many novels, most recently the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Thirteen Steps Down</i>.

Then he got back into the driving seat to move the car deep into a cave made by hawthorn bushes and brambles, and the hop vines which climbed over everything in this wood. It was late June and the vegetation very dense and luxuriant.<br><br>Getting out again and standing back to take a good look, he could barely see the car. Probably he only saw it because he knew it was there. No one else would notice it. He squatted down, hoisted the backpack up on to his shoulders and slowly stood up to his full height. The movement reminded him of something and it was a moment before he realised what it was: lifting up his little son to sit on his shoulders. A hundred years ago, it seemed. The backpack was lighter than the boy but felt heavier to him.<br><br>He was afraid that if he stood upright the pack would jerk him backwards and break his spine. Of course it wouldn&#x2019;t. It just felt that way. All the same, he wouldn&#x2019;t stand upright, wouldn&#x2019;t even try it. Instead, he stooped, bending almost double. It wasn&#x2019;t far. He could walk like this the two hundred yards to the bridge. Anyone seeing him from a distance in this half-light would have thought him a humpbacked man.<br><br>There was no one to see. The twisty country lane wound round Yorstone Wood and over the bridge. He could have brought the car right up to the bridge but that way it would have been seen, so he had driven off the lane along a ride and then through a clearing to find the hop-grown cave. In the distance he thought he heard a car, then something heavier with a diesel engine. They would be on the road below, Brimhurst Lane that ran from Myfleet to Brimhurst Prideaux, passing under Yorstone Bridge ahead of him. It wasn&#x2019;t far now but it seemed like miles. If his legs gave way he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get up again. Would it be easier to drag the backpack? What, then, if he met someone? Dragging something looks much more suspicious than carrying it. He pressed his shoulders back a little and, surprisingly, that was better. There was no one to meet. He could see the lane through the trees and the little stone bridge no one had reinforced with steel or replaced with a brightly painted wooden structure. <br><br>Its parapets were low, too low for safety, according to the local paper. The paper was always on about this bridge, and the dangers of the lane and the low parapets. He walked out on to the bridge, squatted down and let the backpack slip off his shoulders to the ground. He undid the flaps and then the zip. Inside, now revealed, was a lump of concrete, very roughly spherical, a bit bigger than a soccer ball. A pair of gloves was also inside the pack. To be on the safe side, he put them on. Though it would never come to anyone examining his hands, it would be stupid to scrape or bruise them. <br><br>What light remained was fading fast and with the coming of the dark it grew cooler. His watch told him that it was nine fifteen. Not long now. He lifted up the lump of concrete in his gloved hands, thought of balancing it on the parapet in readiness, then thought again. It wasn&#x2019;t beyond the bounds of possibility that someone would come along the path he had used and cross the bridge. Wait for the call, he thought. It won&#x2019;t be long now.<br><br>No traffic had passed along the road below since he had come on to the bridge but a car came now, going towards Brimhurst Prideaux, most probably all the way to Kingsmarkham. He closed his hand over the mobile in his pocket, worried because it hadn&#x2019;t rung. Then it rang.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s left. You want the number again?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got it. A silver Honda.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Right.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A silver Honda. Should be along in four minutes.&#x2019;<br><br>He heard the line close. It was dark now. A car passed under the bridge, heading towards Brimhurst St Mary and Myfleet. The road dipped where the bridge passed over it and then twisted to the left, almost a right-angled bend. There were tall trees on the corner with thick ancient trunks and a black and white arrow sign opposite, pointing traffic to the left. A minute had passed.<br><br>He moved across to the other side of the bridge, dragging the backpack behind him, and there he bent down, heaved up the lump of concrete, his arms straining, and set it on the parapet. Just as well it wasn&#x2019;t far to lift it. Another minute gone. A white van with headlights on at full beam came from the Myfleet direction, a car following it, to pass, just behind him, a motorbike coming from Kingsmarkham. He was momentarily blinded by the headlights, held in them, which made him curse. No one should see him. The silver Honda with the number he had memorised would be along soon, very soon. The third minute passed. A fourth.<br><br>He hated anticlimaxes. The silver Honda could have taken another route. It was all very well to say it never did but you could never say that, not when it came to the way people behaved. He was facing the way it would come, towards Myfleet. It would pass under the bridge but before it reached the left-hand bend . . . He could see lights in the distance. The lights appeared and disappeared as a hedge or a tree trunk cut them from his view, and appeared again. Two sets of lights, not one car but two, both of them silver, quite close together. One was the Honda but he couldn&#x2019;t tell which, not from here, not in the dark, but he could read the number or the last three digits. <br><br>As soon as he had given a great push to the lump on the parapet and felt it drop, he knew he had aimed at the wrong car. The crash was huge, like a bomb. The first car, the one he had hit, ploughed into a tree trunk, its bonnet burst open, its windscreen gone, half its roof caved in. It seemed to have split and exploded. The car behind, undamaged until this point, crashed into its rear and its boot lid sprang open. That was the silver Honda which had been his quarry. As its driver got out of it, screaming, her hands up in the air, he knew he had failed. <br><br>He waited no longer but picked up the backpack and moved, looking back once to see the leading car burst into flames. In the brilliant light which illuminated everything he saw for the first time the woman he had tried to kill.</p><h2>Life is Good!: Lessons in Joyful Living</h2><p>Many readers wonder what inspires the creative genius of bestselling suspense writer Dean Koontz.

Under the rule of the Ottoman sultans, one of the most extraordinary and diverse societies in Europe lived for five centuries amid its minarets and cypresses on the shore of the Aegean, alongside its Roman ruins and Byzantine monasteries. Egyptian merchants and Ukrainian slaves, Spanish-speaking rabbis&#x2013;refugees from the Iberian Inquisition&#x2013;and Turkish pashas rubbed shoulders with Orthodox shopkeepers, Sufi dervishes and Albanian brigands. Creeds clashed and mingled in an atmosphere of shared piety and messianic mysticism. How this bustling, cosmopolitan and tolerant world emerged and then disappeared under the pressure of modern nationalism is the subject of this remarkable book.<br><br>The historian Mark Mazower, author of the greatly praised <i>Dark Continent,</i> follows the city&#x2019;s inhabitants through the terrors of plague, invasion and famine, and takes us into their taverns, palaces, gardens and brothels. Drawing on an astonishing array of primary sources, Mazower&#x2019;s vivid narrative illuminates the multicultural fabric of this great city and describes how its fortunes changed as the empire fell apart and the age of national enmities arrived. In the twentieth century, the Greek army marched in, and fire and world war wrought their grim transformation. Thousands of refugees arrived from Anatolia, the Muslims were forced out, and the Nazis deported and killed the Jews. This richly textured homage to the world that went with them uncovers the memory of what lies buried beneath Salonica&#x2019;s prosperous streets and recounts the haunting story of how the three great faiths that shared the city were driven apart.</p><p>Mark Mazower is professor of history at Columbia University and Birkbeck College, London. His books include <i>Inside Hitler&#x2019;s Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941&#x2014;44,</i> winner of the Fraenkel Prize in Contemporary History and the Longman/History Today Award for Book of the Year. He lives in New York City.<b>Conquest, 1430<br>Beginnings<br></b><br>Before the city fell in 1430, it had already enjoyed seventeen hundred years of life as a Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine metropolis. Sometimes it had flourished, at others it was sacked and looted. Foreigners had seized it and moved on. Throughout it remained a city whose inhabitants spoke Greek. But of this Greek past, only traces survived the Ottoman conquest. A few Christian survivors returned and saw their great churches turned into mosques. The Hippodrome, forum and imperial palace fell into ruins which gradually disintegrated and slipped beneath the slowly rising topsoil, leaving an invisible substratum of catacombs, crypts and secret passages. In a very different era, far in the future, archaeologists would assign new values to the statues, columns and sarcophagi they found, and new rulers&#x2014;after the Ottomans had been defeated in their turn&#x2014;would use them to reshape and redefine the city once more. One thing, however, always survived as a reminder of its Greek origins, however badly it was battered and butchered by time and strangers, and that was its name.<br><br>Salonicco, Selanik, Solun? Salonicha or Salonique? There are at least thirteen medieval variants alone; the city is an indexer&#x2019;s nightmare and a linguist&#x2019;s delight. &#x201c;Is there really a correct pronunciation of Salonika?&#x201d; wrote an English ex-serviceman in 1941. &#x201c;At any rate nearly all of us now spell it with a &#x2018;k.&#x2019; &#x201d; His presumption stirred up a hornet&#x2019;s nest. &#x201c;Why Saloneeka, when every man in the last war knew it as Salonika?&#x201d; responded a certain Mr. Pole from Totteridge. &#x201c;I disagree with W. Pole,&#x201d; wrote Captain Vance from Edgware, Middlesex. &#x201c;Every man in the last war did not know it as Salonika.&#x201d; Mr. Wilks of Newbury tried to calm matters by helpfully pointing out that in 1937 &#x201c;by Greek royal decree, Salonika reverted to Thessaloniki.&#x201d; In fact it had been officially known by the Greek form since the Ottomans were defeated in 1912.1<br><br>It is only foreigners who make things difficult for themselves, for the Greek etymology is perfectly straightforward. The daughter of a local ruler, Philip of Macedon, was called Thessaloniki, and the city was named after her: both daughter and city commemorated the triumph (niki) of her father over the people of Thessaly as he extended Macedonian power throughout Greece. Later of course, his son, Alexander, conquered much more distant lands which took him to the limits of the known world. There were prehistoric settlements in the area, but the city itself is a creation of the fourth-century BC Macedonian state.<br><br>Today the association between the city and the dynasty is as close as it has ever been. If one walks from the White Tower along the wide seafront promenade which winds southeast along the bay, one quickly encounters a huge statue of Megas Alexandros&#x2014;Alexander the Great. Mounted on horseback, sword in hand, he looks down along the five-lane highway (also named after him) out of town, towards the airport, the beaches and the weekend resorts of the Chalkidiki peninsula. The statue rises heroically above the acrobatic skateboarders skimming around the pedestal, the toddlers, the stray dogs and the partygoers queuing up for the brightly lit floating discos and bars which now circumnavigate the bay by night. It is a magnet for the hundreds who stroll here in the summer evenings, escaping the stuffy backstreets for the refreshment of the sea breeze as the sun dips behind the mountains.<br><br>But in 1992, after the collapse of Yugoslavia led the neighbouring republic of Macedonia to declare its independence, Alexander&#x2019;s Greek defenders took to the streets in a very different mood. Flags proliferated in shop-windows, and car stickers and airport banners proclaimed that &#x201c;Macedonia has been, and will always be, Greek.&#x201d; Greeks and Slavs did battle over the legacy of the Macedonian kings, and Salonica was the centre of the agitation. In the main square, hundreds of thousands of angry protestors were urged on by their Metropolitan, Panayiotatos (His Most Holy) Panteleimon (known to some journalists as His Wildness [Panagriotatos] for the extremism of his language). The twentieth century was ending as it had begun, with an argument over Macedonia, and names themselves had become a political issue in a way which few outside Greece understood.<br><br>The irony was that Alexander himself never knew the city named after his half-sister, for it was founded during the succession struggle precipitated by his death. He had a general called Cassander, who was married to Thessaloniki. Cassander hoped to succeed to the Macedonian throne and having murdered Alexander&#x2019;s mother to get there, he founded a number of cities to re-establish his credentials as a statesman. The one he immodestly named after himself has vanished from the pages of history. But that given his wife&#x2019;s name in 315 BC came to join Alexandria itself in the network of new Mediterranean ports that would link the Greek world with the trading routes to Asia, India and Africa.<br><br>As events would prove, Cassander chose his spot well. Built on the slope running down to the sea from the hills in the shadow of Mount Hortiatis, the city gave its inhabitants an easy and comforting sense of orientation: from earliest times, they could see the Gulf before them with Mount Olympos across the bay in the distance, the forested hills and mountains rising behind them, the well-rivered plains stretching away to the west. Less arid than Athens, less hemmed in than Trieste, the new city blended with its surroundings, marking the point where mountains, rivers and sea met. It guarded the most accessible land route from the Mediterranean up into the Balkans and central Europe, down which came Slavs (in the sixth century), and Germans (in 1941) while traders and NATO convoys (on their way into Kosovo in 1999) went in the other direction. Its crucial position between East and West was also later exploited by the Romans, whose seven-hundred-kilometre lifeline between Italy and Anatolia, the Via Egnatia, it straddled.<br><br>Poised between Europe and Asia, the Mediterranean and the Balkans, the interface of two climatic zones brings Salonica highly changeable air pressure throughout the year. Driving winter rains and fogs subdue the spirits, and helped inspire a generation of melancholic modernists in the 1930s. The vicious north wind which blows for days down the Vardar valley has done more damage to the city over the centuries than humans ever managed, whipping up fires and turning them into catastrophes. A bad year can also bring heavy falls of snow, even the occasional ice in the Gulf: freezing temperatures in February 1770 left &#x201c;many poor lying in the streets dead of cold&#x201d;; in the 1960s, snowdrifts blocked all traffic between the Upper Town and the streets below. Yet the city also enjoys Mediterranean summers&#x2014;with relatively little wind, little rain and high daytime temperatures, only slightly softened by the afternoon breeze off the bay.2<br><br>This combination of winter rains and summer sunshine makes for intensive cultivation. Apricots, chestnuts and mulberries grow well here, as do grains, potatoes, cucumbers and melons. Fringed now by the Athens motorway, vegetable gardens still flourish in the alluvial plains&#x2014;&#x201c;our California,&#x201d; a farmer once happily told me. &#x201c;There is excellent shooting in the neighbourhood,&#x201d; noted John Murray&#x2019;s Handbook in 1854, &#x201c;including pheasants, woodcocks, wildfowl etc.&#x201d; Cutting wide loops through the fields the Vardar river to the west runs low in summer, sinuous and fast in the winter months, too powerful to be easily navigable, debouching finally into the miles of thick reedy insect-plagued marshes which line its mouth. All swamp and water, the Vardar plain in December reminded John Morritt at the end of the eighteenth century of nothing so much as &#x201c;the dear country from Cambridge to Ely.&#x201d; For hundreds of years it emanated &#x201c;putrid fevers,&#x201d; noxious exhalations and agues which drove horses mad, and manifested themselves&#x2014;before the age of pesticide&#x2014;in the &#x201c;sallow cheeks and bloodless lips&#x201d; of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants.3<br><br>&#x201c;From water comes everything&#x201d; runs the inscription on an Ottoman fountain still preserved in the Upper Town. Fed by rivers and rains and moisture rising from the bay, water bathes the city and its surroundings in a hazy light quite different from that of parched Attica, softer, stranger and less harsh, shading the western mountains in grey, brown and violet. After days of cloudy and stormy weather, the Reverend Henry Fanshawe Tozer realized &#x201c;what I had never felt before&#x2014;the pleasure of pale colours.&#x201d; Artesian wells are dug easily down to the water table which sits just below the surface of the earth, and there are plentiful springs in the nearby hills. Winter rains have etched beds deep into the soil on either side of the town, torrents so quick to flood that well into the nineteenth century they would carry away a horse and rider, or sluice out the poorly buried bones of the dead in the cemeteries beyond the walls.4<br><br> From earliest times, too, fresh water has been channelled through fountains, aqueducts and underground pipes, attracting the rich and the holy, plane trees, acacias and monasteries, wherever it bubbles to the surface. Archaeologists have traced the remains of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman mills which dotted the water-courses leading down into the city&#x2019;s reservoirs. Until the 1930s, villagers on nearby Mount Hortiatis produced ice from water-bearing rocks in the thickly forested slopes above the town, kept it in small pits cut into the hillside and brought it down by donkey into the city each summer.

The author also wrote &#34;The Dark&#34;.</p><p>John McGahern was born in Dublin in 1934 and brought up in the West of Ireland. He was a graduate of University College, Dublin. He worked as a primary school teacher and held various academic posts at universities in Britain, Ireland and America. The Observer once hailed him as &#39;Ireland&#39;s greatest living novelist&#39;. He was the author of six highly acclaimed novels and four collections of short stories, and was the recipient of numerous awards and honours, including a Society of Authors Travelling Scholarship, the American-Irish Award, the Prix Etrangere Ecureuil, the Chevalier de l&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and, most recently, a South Bank Award for Literature. Amongst Women, which won both the GPA and the Irish Times Award, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1990 and made into a four-part BBC television series. His work has appeared in anthologies and has been translated into many languages. John McGahern died in March 2006, aged 71.A lyric lament for Ireland, McGahern's lovingly observed family drama is dominated by an almost pathetic paterfamilias. Gruff, blustering Michael Moran, former guerrilla hero in the Irish War of Independence, is a man "in permanent opposition." Now a farmer, he vents his compulsion to dominate, his cold fury and sense of betrayal on his three teenage daughters. Yearning for approval but fearing his flare-ups, they periodically beat a path back to the farmhouse from London and Dublin, then take flight again, both proud and dependent. Moran's second wife, Rose, much younger than he, displays saintly patience in her attempts to heal this splintering family. Moran also claims a renegade son in London who is "turning himself into a sort of Englishman," and another son driven away by Moran's threats of beatings. McGahern ( The Dark ; The Pornographer ) has crafted a wise and tender novel whose brooding hero seems emblematic of an Ireland that drives away its sons and daughters. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Atlas of the Crusades (CULTURAL ATLAS OF)</h2><p>The Atlas of the Crusades chronicles Christendom&#39;s Holy Wars, charting the entire 700-year history of the Crusades with a brilliant integration of text, illustrations, and more than 150 maps.</p><p>Maps, narrative, and contemporary accounts trace the history of Christian crusading in the East, the Mediterranean, Spain, Western Europe, and elsewhere.</p><h2>The Anglo Files: A Field Guide to the British</h2><p><p><strong>Dispatches from the new Britain: a slyly funny and compulsively readable portrait of a nation finally refurbished for the twenty-first century.</strong></p> Sarah Lyall, a reporter for the <em>New York Times</em>, moved to London in the mid-1990s and soon became known for her amusing and incisive dispatches on her adopted country. As she came to terms with its eccentric inhabitants (the English husband who never turned on the lights, the legislators who behaved like drunken frat boys, the hedgehog lovers, the people who extracted their own teeth), she found that she had a ringside seat at a singular transitional era in British life. The roller-coaster decade of Tony Blair's New Labor government was an increasingly materialistic time when old-world symbols of aristocratic privilege and stiff-upper-lip sensibility collided with modern consumerism, overwrought emotion, and a new (but still unsuccessful) effort to make the trains run on time. Appearing a half-century after Nancy Mitford's classic <em>Noblesse Oblige</em>, Lyall's book is a brilliantly witty account of twenty-first-century Britain that will be recognized as a contemporary classic.</p><p><strong>Sarah Lyall</strong> a writer-at-large for the <em>New York Times</em>, lived in London until 2013, when she moved back home to New York. She&#x2019;s still adjusting.When New York native Sarah Lyall relocated to England to work for the London branch of the NEW YORK TIMES, she found herself inspired to report beyond what her position required. Veteran audiobook narrator Cassandra Campbell recounts the entertaining story of the author&#39;s transition to her new country, and her study of its history and people. Lending expressive American and British accents to Lyall&#39;s masterful grasp of language and insightful humor, Campbell gives unique identities to the myriad of ordinary and unique characters Lyall encounters as she traverses the isle&#39;s physical and social geography. Campbell&#39;s performance impressively complements the author&#39;s occasionally verbose assembly of posts--both quirky and poignant--as she explores what it truly means to be British.

It is written in the words of a person who came from Lebanon to Canada at the age of sixteen and experienced what it was like to have fate push you to a place where you don&#39;t belong. It is written in the voice of every person who ever felt unheard, mistreated, misjudged or unseen. Mind Platter contains around 200 one-page entries as reflections on different topics that we encounter in our everyday lives; love, friendship, hurt, inspiration, respect, wholeheartedness, motivation, integrity, honesty and more. Mind Platter is not about the words that are in it, but about what the reader makes of them. This book does not only belong to me. It belongs to everyone whose path crossed mine.

Cold monsoon clouds wreath its mile-high summit, concealing a battery of 105-mm howitzers surrounded by deep bunkers, carefully constructed fields of fire and the 180 marines of Bravo Company. Just three kilometres from Laos and two from North Vietnam, there is no more isolated outpost of America&#39;s increasingly desperate war in Vietnam. Second Lieutenant Waino Mellas, 21 years old and just a few days into his 13-month tour, has barely arrived at Matterhorn before Bravo Company is ordered to abandon their mountain and sent deep in-country in pursuit of a North Vietnamese Army unit of unknown size. Beyond the relative safety of the perimeter wire, Mellas will face disease, starvation, leeches, tigers and an almost invisible enemy. Beneath the endless jungle canopy, Bravo Company will confront competing ambitions, duplicitous officers and simmering racial tensions. Behind them, always, Matterhorn. The impregnable mountain fortress they built and then abandoned, without a shot, to the North Vietnamese Army -</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2010</strong>: <em>Matterhorn</em> is a marvel--a living, breathing book with Lieutenant Waino Mellas and the men of Bravo Company at its raw and battered heart. Karl Marlantes doesn't introduce you to Vietnam in his brilliant war epic--he unceremoniously drops you into the jungle, disoriented and dripping with leeches, with only the newbie lieutenant as your guide. Mellas is a bundle of anxiety and ambition, a college kid who never imagined being part of a "war that none of his friends thought was worth fighting," who realized too late that "because of his desire to look good coming home from a war, he might never come home at all." A highly decorated Vietnam veteran himself, Marlantes brings the horrors and heroism of war to life with the finesse of a seasoned writer, exposing not just the things they carry, but the fears they bury, the friends they lose, and the men they follow. <em>Matterhorn</em> is as much about the development of Mellas from boy to man, from the kind of man you fight beside to the man you fight <em>for</em>, as it is about the war itself. Through his untrained eyes, readers gain a new perspective on the ravages of war, the politics and bureaucracy of the military, and the peculiar beauty of brotherhood. <em>--Daphne Durham</em><br><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Mark Bowden Reviews <em>Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War</em></strong> <br> <p> <strong>Mark Bowden</strong> is the bestselling author of <em>Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War</em>, as well as <em>The Best Game Ever</em>, <em>Bringing the Heat</em>, <em>Killing Pablo</em>, and <em>Guests of the Ayatollah</em>. He reported at <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> for twenty years and now writes for <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, and other magazines. He lives in Oxford, Pennsylvania. <br></p> <p><em>Matterhorn</em> is a great novel. There have been some very good novels about the Vietnam War, but this is the first great one, and I doubt it will ever be surpassed. Karl Marlantes overlooks no part of the experience, large or small, from a terrified soldier pondering the nature of good and evil, to the feel and smell of wet earth against scorched skin as a man tries to press himself into the ground to escape withering fire. Here is story-telling so authentic, so moving and so intense, so relentlessly dramatic, that there were times I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could stand to turn the page. As with the best fiction, I was sad to reach the end.</p> <p>The wrenching combat in <em>Matterhorn</em> is ultimately pointless; the marines know they are fighting a losing battle in the long run. Bravo Company carves out a fortress on the top of the hill so named, one of countless low, jungle-coated mountains near the border of Laos, only to be ordered to abandon it when they are done. After the enemy claims the hill&#x2019;s deep bunkers and carefully constructed fields of fire, the company is ordered to take it back, to assault their own fortifications. They do so with devastating consequences, only to be ordered in the end to abandon Matterhorn once again.</p> <p>Against this backdrop of murderous futility, Marlantes&#x2019; memorable collection of marines is pushed to its limits and beyond. As the deaths and casualties mount, the men display bravery and cowardice, ferocity and timidity, conviction and doubt, hatred and love, intelligence and stupidity. Often these opposites are contained in the same person, especially in the book&#x2019;s compelling main character, Second Lt. Waino Mellas. As Mellas and his men struggle to overcome impossible barriers of landscape, they struggle to overcome similarly impossible barriers between each other, barriers of race and class and rank. Survival forces them to cling to each other and trust each other and ultimately love each other. There has never been a more realistic portrait or eloquent tribute to the nobility of men under fire, and never a more damning portrait of a war that ground them cruelly underfoot for no good reason.</p> <p>Marlantes brilliantly captures the way combat morphs into clean abstraction as fateful decisions move up the chain of command, further and further away from the actual killing and dying. But he is too good a novelist to paint easy villains. His commanders make brave decisions and stupid ones. High and low there is the same mix of cowardice and bravery, ambition and selflessness, ineptitude and competence.</p> <p>There are passages in this book that are as good as anything I have ever read. This one comes late in the story, when the main character, Mellas, has endured much, has killed and also confronted the immediate likelihood of his own death, and has digested the absurdity of his mission: "He asked for nothing now, nor did he wonder if he had been good or bad. Such concepts were all part of the joke he&#x2019;d just discovered. He cursed God directly for the savage joke that had been played on him. And in that cursing Mellas for the first time really talked with his God. Then he cried, tears and snot mixing together as they streamed down his face, but his cries were the rage and hurt of a newborn child, at last, however roughly, being taken from the womb."</p> <p>Vladimir Nabokov once said that the greatest books are those you read not just with your heart or your mind, but with your spine. This is one for the spine. <em>--Mark Bowden</em></p>A graduate of Yale University and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Karl Marlantes served as a Marine in Vietnam, where he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valour, two Purple Hearts and ten air medals.

Three honeymoon weeks in Rhodes had given them both healthy glows and brightened the silver streaks in the raven hair of Caitlin "Kitty" O&#x2019;Reilly n�e O&#x2019;Hallorhan. <br> <br>"It feels very good to be home, Fingal, and in what&#x2019;s now my home, too," she said, stretching out a hand and covering his. <br> <br>"And it does be good to have you both back, so." Mrs. Maureen "Kinky" Kincaid came in bringing a tray with two plates, each bearing a full Irish breakfast. She set one in front of Kitty. "Now eat up however little much is in it, Miss&#x2014;" She frowned. <br> <br>Oh-oh, Fingal thought, Kinky&#x2019;s having difficulty working out the proper form of address between the housekeeper and the mistress of the house. "Miss Kitty" had been fine before the wedding. "Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly" would be too formal. "Mrs. Kitty" sounded odd. He waited, a tiny smile playing on his lips. <br> <br>"Kinky," Kitty said, "plain Kitty&#x2019;s fine. Aren&#x2019;t we friends?" <br> <br>"We are, so." Kinky&#x2019;s two chins wobbled as she chuckled and said, "Indeed we are so, Kitty, bye. And there&#x2019;s your breakfast, sir. I&#x2019;ve done the rashers crisp, the way you like them." <br> <br>The telephone in the hall began its double-ringing clamour. "I&#x2019;ll see who that is," she said. <br> <br>"That was gracious, Kitty," O&#x2019;Reilly said, feeling his mouth water, "and it&#x2019;s a great relief to me that you and Kinky are getting on so well now." He stabbed a ring of black pudding, sliced it, and shoved half into his mouth. Greek grub had been all right, but it was great to get back to Kinky&#x2019;s proper Irish cooking. He was, as she often remarked, "a grand man for the pan." <br> <br>"We&#x2019;d better," Kitty said, and smiled. "It&#x2019;ll be a whole new experience for you, having three women in the house and no fun at all if two of them are at loggerheads." <br> <br>"True enough." Young Barry Laverty, who had been O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s assistant until recently, had gone to Ballymena for training in obstetrics and gynaecology. His place as temporary assistant had been taken by one Doctor Jennifer Bradley, who was out on a maternity case this Saturday morning. "At least," he said, "having Jenny living and working here lets me have some weekends off. After breakfast, let&#x2019;s pop in and see Donal and Julie Donnelly and the new chissler. Kinky tells me the wee lass arrived three days after we left, so her birthday&#x2019;s July 6." <br> <br>"I&#x2019;ll put that in my diary when we&#x2019;ve finished breakfast&#x2014;" <br> <br>"Sir." Kinky stood in the doorway. The colour had left her cheeks. "It&#x2019;s the marquis. His sister, Lady MacNeill, has had a riding accident." <br> <br>Fingal ran to the phone, bolting the black pudding as he did. Young ones being born, middle-aged ones falling off their bloody horses. The daily round of the country G.P., a job he&#x2019;d loved for more than twenty years. And he was duty bound to answer this call even if it was his weekend off. He grabbed the receiver. "John? What&#x2019;s up?" <br> <br>He listened as John MacNeill, marquis of Ballybucklebo, explained how his sister had been thrown when her gelding, Bramble, balked at a jump. "You reckon her leg&#x2019;s bust? I see. Is she conscious? Good. No trouble breathing? Good. John, don&#x2019;t try to move her. Keep her warm, don&#x2019;t give her anything to eat or drink, and I&#x2019;ll be right out." He slammed the receiver into its cradle. "Kinky, get an ambulance out to Ballybucklebo House." He stuck his head into the dining room. "Kitty, the marquis&#x2019;s sister has been hurt. I&#x2019;m heading straight out there. Shouldn&#x2019;t be too long." <br> <br>"I&#x2019;m coming&#x2014;" Kitty started to rise. <br> <br>"Finish your breakfast." There was no time to waste on politeness or explanations. He had to get out there now, and even if she was a nurse, there was nothing Kitty could do. As he crossed the hall, O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s stomach grumbled. Couldn&#x2019;t be helped, but Lord, that soup�on of black pudding had been delicious. He grabbed his bag from the surgery and charged down the hall. Lady Macbeth, his white cat, leapt for the stairs, scrabbled between the bars of the banister, arched her back, fluffed her tail, and spat. <br> <br>He raced through the back garden yelling, "Stay, Arthur," when the big black Labrador stuck his muzzle out of his kennel. <br> <br>In moments O&#x2019;Reilly was in the long-nosed Rover, roaring along the main Belfast to Bangor Road. He barely noticed a cyclist taking refuge in the ditch. Up the gravelled drive, past the oddly shaped topiary in front of Ballybucklebo House, round its Virginia-creeper-covered gable end. The gate was open to an adjoining paddock, where he saw a saddled bay horse, reins dangling, cropping the grass. Two men squatted beside a figure lying near a two-bar jump. <br> <br>The old Rover jounced across the field, shuddered to a halt, and O&#x2019;Reilly, bag in hand, dismounted close to the marquis and his butler/valet Thompson. Both were coatless, their jackets covering the prone Myrna even though the sun was splitting the heavens. Fingal felt its early-morning heat and heard the burbling of wood pigeons from a nearby coppice and the <i>Kek-kek-kek</i> of a cock pheasant. <br> <br>"Fingal," John O&#x2019;Neill said. "Thank you so much for coming so quickly. Thompson and I have done as you told us." <br> <br>"Good." He knelt. "Myrna, please don&#x2019;t turn your head, but can you hear me?" <br> <br>Until he was satisfied that she hadn&#x2019;t hurt her spine it was critical that Myrna not move. <br> <br>"I can hear you perfectly clearly, Fingal, thank you." <br> <br>"Where are you sore?" <br> <br>"I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll have a bruise like a soup plate on my backside, but it&#x2019;s my right thigh. I distinctly heard the bone snap. It&#x2019;s aching now to beat Bannagher and I can feel the muscles all knotted up." He was impressed by how calm she sounded describing what was, almost certainly, the muscle spasms associated with fractures of the femoral shaft. "And no, I didn&#x2019;t land on my head." He noticed that her John Bull top hat was still firmly in place. "I was getting ready for next week&#x2019;s gymkhana. Bloody horse has never refused before and I should be putting him at the jump again, but clearly I&#x2019;m not fit to do that." <br> <br>"Lie still, Myrna," O&#x2019;Reilly said. <br> <br>"I wonder, Thompson, if you&#x2019;d be good enough to catch Bramble?" said the marquis. "Take him back to the stables." He spoke to his sister. "I don&#x2019;t want you fretting about your horse. Don&#x2019;t worry, Myrna. I&#x2019;ll get him over that damned jump once I know you&#x2019;re settled." <br> <br>"Thank you, John." <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly ran through the routine assessment of a patient who had fallen. When he examined her lower limbs, he had already satisfied himself that she had suffered no head or spinal cord injury at least as far down as the first lumbar vertebra, and if she was feeling pain in her thigh and could sense the spasms, it was probable that the second and third were unaffected too. The fuller neurological assessment could wait until she was in the hands of the orthopaedic specialists at the Musgrave and Clark Clinic, the private hospital associated with the Royal Victoria Hospital. Right now, he had no concerns about moving Myrna once her leg had been splinted. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly glanced at his watch. "I&#x2019;ve sent for an ambulance," he said. "Should be at the hall soon. Could you meet them, John? Bring them round here." <br> <br>"Of course." The marquis left. <br> <br>"I need to have a look at the leg, Myrna," O&#x2019;Reilly said, not relishing what he had to do. <br> <br>"Go ahead, Doctor." She smiled, then winced. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly looked at her right riding boot. The toes were pointing to the side at an unnatural angle and the whole leg seemed to be about an inch shorter than the left. He took a deep breath and gently laid both hands on her jodhpurs at the top of her right thigh. When he approached mid-thigh he heard Myrna sucking in her breath. "Sorry," he said. <br> <br>"That bloody well hurt." He saw how pale she was and a drop of blood where she had bitten her lip. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly was certain Myrna had fractured the shaft of her right femur. "Your diagnosis is correct, I&#x2019;m afraid," he said. "It is broken. We&#x2019;ll have to get you to the Clinic and have it set. In fact, I think I hear the ambulance arriving now. I&#x2019;ll give you something for the pain." <br> <br>The ambulance driver and attendant were efficient, waited patiently until the quarter grain of morphine he had given her took effect before they applied a Thomas traction splint to immobilise the break, realign the ends of the broken bone, and reduce muscle spasm and further soft tissue injury. Introduced by the Welsh surgeon Hugh Owen Thomas in 1916, this type of splint had reduced the mortality rate for femoral shaft fractures from 80 to 8 percent. <br> <br>The ambulance driver tied a label to her hacking jacket collar. The red "M" indicated she&#x2019;d been given morphine. <br> <br>She said drowsily, "Thank you, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly," as they loaded her into the primrose yellow Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority ambulance. It drove off, slowly at first, across the irregular ground in the field. The injury, now the splint had been applied, was hardly life-threatening, so there were no accompanying flashing lights or screaming sirens. <br> <br>"She&#x2019;ll be grand, John," O&#x2019;Reilly said to the marquis. "As good as new. Broken bones are pretty routine stuff today." Not, he thought, like in my student and junior doctor days. Fingal decided not to worry the marquis by talking about potential complications like nonunion of the bones or deep venous thrombosis in an immobilised limb. <br> <br>"I appreciate your coming out, Fingal, and your reassurance," the marquis said, "and I&#x2019;m sure she will be fine. Myrna&#x2019;s a tough old bird." He nodded toward the house. "I suppose it&#x2019;s a bit early for a Jameson, but if you&#x2019;d like a cuppa?" <br> <br>"Much too early for whiskey," said Fingal, "and as I hadn&#x2019;t even finished my breakfast. I&#x2019;ll be trotting on, thank you, John." He opened the car&#x2019;s door and chucked his bag inside. <br> <br>"Understood," said the marquis, stooping to retrieve his and Thompson&#x2019;s coats, "but now you&#x2019;re home from abroad you and Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly must come round soon. Have a bite." <br> <br>"We&#x2019;d like that," O&#x2019;Reilly said, thinking how much he liked the "we," "but it&#x2019;s home James, and don&#x2019;t spare the horses for me now." <br> <br>On the drive back to Number One, O&#x2019;Reilly let his thoughts roam. He&#x2019;d phone and arrange for Myrna MacNeill to be looked after by Sir Donald Cromie, one of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s classmates and close friends from their student days in Dublin. Cromie&#x2019;d studied under Mister Jimmy Withers, the first orthopaedic surgeon in Northern Ireland. Fingal&#x2019;s other great friend, Charlie Greer, was now a consultant neurosurgeon at the Royal Victoria. <br> <br>It had been an interesting road Fingal O&#x2019;Reilly had travelled to get here; G.P. in Dublin, junior doctor in the Rotunda Maternity Hospital there, then assistant to Doctor Flanagan here in Ballybucklebo before the war. He&#x2019;d been briefly married when he was a naval surgeon on a British battleship, and then after the war the widowed principal in his present practice. He frowned. The first years here had been lonely ones without her, but Fingal was single no more and he knew his first wife Deirdre would fully approve of Kitty, and that thought drove away his frown and brought a smile to the dark eyes he&#x2019;d inherited from his father. <br> <br>He could recall in detail his interview for that very first job, and his first-ever case as a newly qualified doctor. That had been a patient with a fracture too, but unlike today, in 1936 the outlook was not as good. <br> <br>It took no effort to see himself twenty-seven, one week qualified, standing in Aungier Place in Dublin&#x2019;s Liberties slums ready to go into the building that housed the dispensary practice presided over by one Doctor Phelim Corrigan. <br> <br>Copyright � 2013 by Ballybucklebo Stories Corp <br> <p></p></p><h2>The Story of England</h2><p>In The Story of England Michael Wood tells the extraordinary story of one English community over fifteen centuries, from the moment that the Roman Emperor Honorius sent his famous letter in 410 advising the English to look to their own defences to the village as it is today. The village of Kibworth in Leicestershire lies at the very centre of England. It has a church, some pubs, the Grand Union Canal, a First World War Memorial - and many centuries of recorded history. In the thirteenth century the village was bought by William de Merton, who later founded Merton College, Oxford, with the result that documents covering 750 years of village history are lodged at the college. Building on this unique archive, and enlisting the help of the current inhabitants of Kibworth, with a village-wide archeological dig, with the first complete DNA profile of an English village and with use of local materials like family memorabilia, the story of Kibworth is the story of England itself, a &#39;Who Do You Think You Are?&#39; for the entire nation. &#39;Better than any historian for decades, [in In Search of England] Wood brings home not just the ways in which buildings, landscapes and written texts may be read, but the sensual beauty of encounters with them&#39; TLS Michael Wood was born and educated in Manchester.

Most of the famous people in the new DK Biography series have been well covered in books, films, and plays, and their autobiographies have remained international best-sellers. That said, these attractive books are, nonetheless, highly readable, worthwhile overviews for young people that introduce both personal and wider background and historical issues. For <i>Anne Frank</i>, Sawyer drew extensively on several sources, including the <i>Diary</i> in its various versions and accounts by Anne's father and their rescuer Miep Gies. Her clear history makes this a good place to start research. Less has been written about Keller, so many readers will find Garrett's book a fascinating first look at the amazing woman, blind and deaf since childhood, who, helped by a devoted teacher, learned to read and speak and traveled the world as an inspiring public speaker and political activist. The publisher's familiar illustration-rich page design works well in the smaller format of this series, and the smooth narratives are broken up on every page with boxed facts and quotes as well as well-chosen, small color photos.

Their efforts to investigate the mysterious deaths of a prestigious librarian and the Speaker of the House eventually overlap with another story line--this one about sassy con artist Annabelle Conroy. The multivoiced narration provides needed definition for many of the characters but seems awkward accompanied by the author's stilted dialogue tags. Aimee Jolson depicts a smooth and confident Conroy, while L.J. Ganser and Richard Mover cover the male characters and the narration. Overall, this is a modestly entertaining sequel, thanks mostly to the fast-moving plot.

James served in the forensic and criminal justice departments of the Home Office until her retirement in 1979. She was made a Life Peer in 1991. Her many detective novels include Original Sin, A Certain Justice and Death in Holy Orders.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>Dr. Paul Steiner, consulting psychiatrist at the Steen Clinic, sat in the front ground floor consulting-room and listened to his patient's highly rationalized explanation of the failure of his third marriage. Mr. Burge lay in comfort on a couch the better to expound the complications of his psyche. Dr. Steiner sat at his head in a chair of the carefully documented type which the Hospital Management Committee had decreed for the use of consultants. It was functional and not unattractive but it gave no support to the back of the head. From time to time a sharp jerk of his neck muscles recalled Dr. Steiner from momentary oblivion to the realities of his Friday evening psychotherapy clinic. The October day had been very warm. After a fortnight of sharp frosts during which the staff of the clinic had shivered and pleaded, the official date for starting the central heating had coincided with one of those perfect autumn days when the city square outside had brimmed with yellow light and the late dahlias in the railed garden, bright as a paintbox, had shone like the gauds of high summer. It was now nearly seven o'clock. Outside, the warmth of the day had long given way, first to mist and then to chilly darkness. But here, inside the clinic, the heat of noon was trapped, the air, heavy and still, seemed spent with the breath of too much talking.<br><br>Mr. Burge enlarged on the immaturity, coldness and insensitivity of his wives in a querulous falsetto. Dr. Steiner's clinical judgment, not uninfluenced by the late effects of a large lunch and the unwise choice of a cream doughnut with his afternoon tea, told him that the time was not yet ripe to point out that the one defect shared by the three mesdames Burge had been a singular lack of judgment in their choice of husband. Mr. Burge was not yet ready to face the truth of his own inadequacy.<br><br>Dr. Steiner felt no moral indignation about his patient's behaviour. It would indeed have been most unethical had any such improper emotion clouded his judgment. There were few things in life which aroused Dr. Steiner's moral indignation and most of them affected his own comfort. Many of them were, indeed, concerned with the Steen Clinic and its administration. He disapproved strongly of the administrative officer, Miss Bolam, whose preoccupation with the number of patients he saw in a session and the accuracy of his travelling expense form he saw as part of a systematic policy of persecution. He resented the fact that his Friday evening clinic coincided with Dr. James Baguley's electro-convulsive therapy session so that his psychotherapy patients, all of them of high intelligence and sensible of the privilege of being treated by him, had to sit in the waiting-room with the motley crowd of depressed suburban housewives and ill-educated psychotics that Baguley seemed to delight in collecting. Dr. Steiner had refused the use of one of the third-floor consulting-rooms. These had been formed by partitioning the large and elegant Georgian rooms and he despised them as badly proportioned and unpleasing cells, ill-suited either to his grade or to the importance of his work. Nor had he found it convenient to change the time of his session. Baguley, therefore, should change his. But Dr. Baguley had stood firm and in this, too, Dr. Steiner had seen the influence of Miss Bolam. His plea that the ground floor consulting-rooms should be sound-proofed had been turned down by the Hospital Management Committee on the grounds of expense. There had, however, been no demur over providing Baguley with a new and highly expensive contraption for shocking his patients out of the few wits they still possessed. The matter, had, of course, been considered by the Clinic Medical Committee, but Miss Bolam had made no secret of where her sympathies lay. In his diatribes against the administrative officer, Dr. Steiner found it convenient to forget that her influence over the Medical Committee was non-existent.<br><br>It was difficult to forget the irritations of the E.C.T. session. The clinic building had been put up when men built to last, but even the sturdy oak door of the consulting-room could not muffle the comings and goings of a Friday night. The front door was closed at 6 p.m. and patients at the evening clinics were booked in and out since the time, over five years ago, when a patient had entered unobserved, secreted herself in the basement lavatory and chosen that insalubrious place in which to kill herself. Dr. Steiner's psychotherapy sessions were punctuated by the ringing of the front-door bell, the passing of feet as patients came and went, the hearty voices of relatives and escorts exhorting the patient or calling good-byes to Sister Ambrose. Dr. Steiner wondered why relatives found it necessary to shout at the patients as if they were deaf as well as psychotic. But possibly after a session with Baguley and his diabolic machine they were. Worst of all was the clinic domestic assistant, Mrs. Shorthouse. One might imagine that Amy Shorthouse could do the cleaning early in the mornings as was surely the normal arrangement. That way there would be the minimum of disturbance to the clinic staff. But Mrs. Shorthouse maintained that she couldn't get through the work without an extra two hours in the evenings and Miss Bolam had agreed. Naturally, she would. It appeared to Dr. Steiner that very little domestic work was done on Friday evenings. Mrs. Shorthouse had a predilection for the E.C.T. patients -- indeed, her own husband had once been treated by Dr. Baguley -- and she was usually to be seen hanging around the hall and the ground floor general office while the session was being held. Dr. Steiner had mentioned it at the Medical Committee more than once and had been irritated by his colleagues' general uninterest in the problem. Mrs. Shorthouse should be kept out of sight and encouraged to get on with her work, not permitted to stand around gossiping with the patients. Miss Bolam, so unnecessarily strict with other members of the staff, showed no inclination to discipline Mrs. Shorthouse. Everyone knew that good domestic workers were hard to get but an administrative officer who knew her job would recruit them somehow. Weakness solved nothing. But Baguley could not be persuaded to complain about Mrs. Shorthouse and Bolam would never criticize Baguley. The poor woman was probably in love with him. It was up to Baguley to take a firm line instead of sloping around the clinic in that ridiculously long white coat which made him look like a second-rate dentist. Really, the man had no idea of the dignity with which a consultant clinic should be conducted.<br><br>Clump, clump went someone's boots along the passage. It was probably old Tippett, a chronic schizophrenic patient of Baguley's who, for the past nine years, had regularly spent Friday evenings carving wood in the art therapy department. The thought of Tippett increased Dr. Steiner's petulance. The man was totally unsuitable for the Steen. If he were well enough to be out of hospital, which Dr. Steiner doubted, he ought to attend a Day Hospital or one of the County Council's sheltered workshops. It was patients like Tippett who gave the clinic a dubious reputation and obscured its real function as an analytically orientated centre of psychotherapy. Dr. Steiner felt positively embarrassed when one of his own carefully selected patients encountered Tippett creeping about the clinic on a Friday evening. Tippett wasn't even safe to be out. One day there would be an incident and Baguley would find himself in trouble.<br><br>Dr. Steiner's happy contemplation of his colleague in trouble was punctured by the ring of the front-door bell. Really, it was impossible! This time it was apparently a hospital car service driver calling for a patient. Mrs. Shorthouse went to the door to speed them away. Her eldritch screech echoed through the hall. "Cheerio, ducks. See you next week. If you can't be good be careful."<br><br>Dr. Steiner winced and shut his eyes. But his patient, happily engaged in his favourite hobby of talking about himself, seemed not to have heard. Mr. Burge's high whine had not, in fact, faltered for the past twenty minutes.<br><br>"I don't pretend I'm an easy person. I'm not, I'm a complicated devil. That's something which Theda and Sylvia had never understood. The roots of it go deep of course. You remember that session we had in June? Some pretty basic stuff came out then I thought."<br><br>His therapist did not recall the session in question but was unconcerned. With Mr. Burge pretty basic stuff was invariably near the surface and could be trusted to emerge. An unaccountable peace fell. Dr. Steiner doodled on his notepad, regarded his doodle with interest, and concern, looked at it again with the pad held upside down and became for a moment more preoccupied with his own subconscious than with that of his patient. Suddenly he became aware of another sound from outside, faint at first and then becoming louder. Somewhere a woman was screaming. It was a horrible noise, high, continuous, and completely animal. Its effect on Dr. Steiner was peculiarly unpleasant. He was naturally timid and highly strung. Although his job involved him in the occasional emotional crises he was more adept at circumventing than coping with an emergency. Fear gave vent to irritation and he sprang from his chair exclaiming.<br><br>"No! Really, this is too bad! What's Miss Bolam doing? Isn't anyone supposed to be in charge here?"<br><br>"What's up?" inquired Mr. Burge, sitting up like a jack-in-the-box and dropping his voice half an octave to its more normal tone.<br><br>"Nothing. Nothing. Some woman having an attack of hysteria that's all. Stay where you are. I'll be back," commanded Dr. Steiner.<br><br>Mr. Burge collapsed again but with eye and ear cocked for the door. Dr. Steiner found himself in the hall.<br><br>Immediately a little group swung round to face him. Jennifer Priddy, the junior typist, was clinging to one of the porters, Peter Nagle, who was patting her shoulder in embarrassed pity and looking puzzled. Mrs. Shorthouse was with them. The girl's screams were subsiding into whimpers but her whole body was shaking, and she was deathly pale.<br><br>"What's the matter?" asked Dr. Steiner sharply. "What's wrong with her?"<br><br>Before anyone had a chance to reply the door of the E.C.T. room opened and Dr. Baguley came out followed by Sister Ambrose and his anaesthetist, Dr. Mary Ingram. The hall seemed suddenly full of people. "Calm down, that's a good girl," said Dr. Baguley mildly. "We're trying to run a clinic." He turned to Peter Nagle and asked in a low voice: "What's the matter anyway?"<br><br>Nagle seemed about to speak when, suddenly, Miss Priddy gained control. Breaking free of him she turned to Dr. Baguley and said with absolute clearness:<br><br>"It's Miss Bolam. She's dead. Someone's killed her. She's in the basement record room and she's murdered. I found her. Enid's been murdered!"<br><br>She clung to Nagle and began to cry again but more quietly. The dreadful shaking had ceased. Dr. Baguley said to the porter:<br><br>"Take her into the treatment-room. Make her lie down. Better give her something to drink. Here's the key. I'll be back."<br><br>He made for the basement stairs and the rest, abandoning the girl to Nagle's ministrations, followed in a jostling bunch. The basement at the Steen was well lit; all its rooms were used by the clinic which, like most psychiatric units, was chronically short of space. Here, below stairs, in addition to the boiler-room, the telephone equipment-room and the porters' quarters, was the art therapy department, a medical records storeroom and, at the front of the building, a treatment-room for the lysergic acid patients. As the little group reached the bottom of the stairs the door of this room opened and Nurse Bolam, Miss Bolam's cousin, looked out briefly -- a shadowy wraith in her white uniform against the darkness of the room behind. Her gentle, puzzled voice floated to them down the corridor. "Is there anything wrong? I thought I heard a scream a few minutes ago."<br><br>Sister Ambrose said with brusque authority:<br><br>"There's nothing wrong, Nurse. Get back to your patient."<br><br>The white figure disappeared and the door was shut. Turning to Mrs. Shorthouse, Sister Ambrose went on:<br><br>"And there's nothing for you to do here, Mrs. Shorthouse. Please stay upstairs. Miss Priddy might like a cup of tea."<br><br>Mrs. Shorthouse was heard to mutter rebelliously but beat a reluctant retreat. The three doctors, with sister in tow, pressed on.<br><br>The medical record-room was on their right, between the porters' rest-room and the art therapy department. The door was ajar and the light was on.<br><br>Dr. Steiner, who had become unnaturally aware of every small detail, noticed the key was in the lock. No one was about. The steel racks, with their tight-packed rows of manilla folders, ran ceiling high and at right angles to the door forming a series of narrow aisles, each lit by a fluorescent light. The four high windows were barred and dissected by the racks; it was an airless little room rarely visited and seldom dusted. The little group pushed its way down the first passage and turned left to where there was a small windowless space clear of shelving and furnished with a table and chair where records could be sorted for filing or information copied from the notes without the need to take the file away. Here was chaos. The chair was overturned. The floor was littered with records. Some had their covers wrenched apart and their pages torn, others lay dumped in shifting layers beneath gaps on the shelves which looked too narrow to have held such a weight of paper. And in the middle of this confusion, like a plump and incongruous Ophelia afloat on a tide of paper, was the body of Enid Bolam. On her chest rested a heavy and grotesque image carved in wood, her hands folded about its base so that she looked, horribly, like a parody of motherhood with her creature ritually laid to her breast.<br><br>There could be no doubt that she was dead. Even in the midst of his fear and repugnance Dr. Steiner could not miss that final diagnosis. Staring at the wooden figure he cried:<br><br>"Tippett! That's his fetish! That's the carving he's so proud of. Where is he? Baguley, he's your patient! You'd better handle this!"<br><br>He looked round nervously as if expecting Tippett to materialize, arm raised to strike, the very personification of violence.<br><br>Dr. Baguley was kneeling by the body. He said quietly:<br><br>"Tippett isn't here this evening."<br><br>"But he's always here on Fridays! That's his fetish! That's the weapon!" Dr. Steiner wailed against such obtuseness.<br><br>Dr. Baguley gently lifted Miss Bolam's left eyelid with his thumb. Without looking up he said:<br><br>"We had a phone call from St. Luke's this morning. Tippett's been admitted with pneumonia. Last Monday, I think. Anyway, he wasn't here this evening." Suddenly he gave a exclamation. The two women bent closer to the body. Dr. Steiner, who could not bring himself to watch the examination, heard him say:<br><br>"She's been stabbed, too. Through the heart by the look of it and with a black-handled chisel. Isn't this one of Nagle's, Sister?" There was a pause and Dr. Steiner heard Sister's voice:<br><br>"It looks very like it, Doctor. All his tools have black handles. He keeps them in the porters' rest-room." She added defensively, "Anyone could get at them."<br><br>"It looks as if someone has." There was the sound of Dr. Baguley getting to his feet. Still keeping his eyes on the body he said: "Phone Cully on the door, will you, Sister. Don't alarm him, but tell him that no one is to be admitted or to leave the building. That includes the patients. Then get Dr. Etherege and ask him to come down. He'll ...</p><h2>The Bungalow: America&#39;s Arts and Crafts Home</h2><p>The essential popularity of the California bungalow style, which made it one of the most prolific housing styles in American architectural history, and which quickly spread throughout the country, was due to its economy of construction that incorporated the combined structural and decorative use of modest materials. Popular at the turn of the twentieth century and for many years afterword, the bungalow is of special interest today for being the home of the American Arts and Crafts style.<br>In the very early years of the century America was putting down its roots and searching for its own identity in housing architecture. It wasn't until the bungalow style emerged unfettered by Greek, Gothic, or Italianate overtones that America finally had a domestic architectural style to call its own.<br>In this landmark book - the first on this important subject to be published almost entirely in color - one is able to appreciate the almost infinite variety of the bungalow style. The book contains 197 illustrations of which 182 are in full color and include 102 exterior photographs and 80 that show the beauty of the interior architecture, furnishings, and decorative objects.<br>The authoritative introduction to The Bungalow goes into significant and informative detail about the development of the bungalow, the various components of its design, the business of marketing the bungalow, and the preservation of bungalow's today. The main pictorial sections of the book illustrate many houses in the major Craftsman style as well as some of the lesser styles like Swiss Chalet, Spanish Colonial, Prairie, and Oriental. Additional sections are devoted to very large Arts and Crafts houses like the great Gamble House in Pasadena, California, to bungalows with fine restoration work, and to new houses created in the bungalow style.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to live in a Craftsman-style bungalow house--as I have for nearly a decade--to appreciate the popular architectural style that flourished in the early 20th century, or this handsome book devoted to it. Interior designer Paul Duchscherer and photographer Douglas Keister have combined their talents to give the bungalow its due, defining the style and its variations, discussing its influences and its evolution. Keister has a great eye for color and design; he is a man who loves wood and makes no bones about it. Warning: you may want to talk to a real estate agent about a Craftsman of your own after looking at the beautiful homes in this volume.</p><h2>The complete short stories of H. G. Wells</h2><p>Herbert George Wells was perhaps best known as the author of such classic works of science fiction as The Time Machine and War of the Worlds. But it was in his short stories, written when he was a young man embarking on a literary career, that he first explored the enormous potential of the scientific discoveries of the day. He described his stories as &#34;a miscellany of inventions,&#34; yet his enthusiasm for science was tempered by an awareness of its horrifying destructive powers and the threat it could pose to the human race. A consummate storyteller, he made fantastic creatures and machines entirely believable, and by placing ordinary men and women in extraordinary situations, he explored, with humor, what it means to be alive in a century of rapid scientific progress.

He didn&#x2019;t care if the ground was sodden with rainfall as he collapsed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he could manage it, he&#x2019;d fall dead into the water. At least that way he could be sure. To survive and be brought to a hospital was unthinkable. They would contact his family, such as it was, and his sister Ida would go to his house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the things she would find there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He should have destroyed them, but he couldn&#x2019;t, he was not strong enough to take that action and endure the consequences. It would be easier simply to die. At least if he was gone, he would not have to face that terrible discovery. The real Raymond Drew, the creature that had hidden beneath this human skin for more than six decades, would be revealed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond locked the front door of his house, the three-bedroom semi on Deramore Gardens he&#x2019;d lived in for thirty years. Just one of many identical structures on this street, red brick, early 1900s, the kind of houses that middle-class couples and property developers were falling over themselves to buy until the financial crisis. Raymond had shared the first two years here with a wife he&#x2019;d barely known, let alone loved. Dead and buried now, and he hadn&#x2019;t missed her for a moment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tucked the keys into his pocket. The grass of his lawn looked like stubble on a drunkard&#x2019;s chin. He hadn&#x2019;t cut it in years. The man next door, Hughes his name was, gave up asking Raymond to mow it and did it himself every few weeks. The spring would soon start it growing again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that it mattered to Raymond any more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He left his car on the driveway, closed the gate behind him, and walked. The Vauxhall Corsa didn&#x2019;t have an MOT or tax. It hadn&#x2019;t been driven in months.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes took him down the shallow incline of Sunnyside Sreet, past the corner shops and Chinese takeaways, to Annadale Embankment. He avoided eye contact with students and housewives on the way. At the bridge by the river, he waited at the pedestrian crossing for the green man to appear and tell him to go. Like a good boy. Raymond had learned to be a good boy long ago, to be quiet, respectful, obey all rules while outside his home. Not to draw attention.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once across the dark slow-moving water to the Stranmillis side, he walked south along the river&#x2019;s edge, beneath the bony branches of the still winter-bare trees. Past the newly rebuilt Lyric Theatre, on further, the blocks of apartments with their waterside views. Traffic rumbled to his right, cars, vans and lorries filtering in and out of the city, heading north or east.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sickly swelling in his chest, pulsing, robbing him of breath. He did not slow his pace, even as the sweat dripped from his eyebrows. Cold on his back, running down his spine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond had gone to the doctor two months before. A softspoken and serious young woman, she had talked about medication, pills, things to ease the tired muscle in his breast. She talked about more tests, bloods, wires tethered to his skin, a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was serious, the young doctor had said. It was only a matter of time before an attack came, perhaps a big one. Appointments were made, a prescription printed on patterned paper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond did not keep the appointments, nor did he have the prescription filled. He simply wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been a month since the fluttering in his chest had intensified. Then the dizzy spells, the cold sweats, the feeling of his torso being crushed by some invisible hand. He awoke throughout the night, gasping, wild horses galloping inside his ribcage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a matter of time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cool wave washed across his brow, and his legs weakened. He gripped the railing to steady himself. Waited while the blood coursed through his body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pub just ahead, perched on the riverbank, tables and benches and umbrellas damp and pathetic in the grey. A drink. Just one last swallow to see it done.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond entered the pub. The only other patrons were a pair<br>of businessmen comparing charts over cups of coffee. They did<br>not notice him. But the girl behind the bar did.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He approached. The girl smiled. Blonde hair tied back, dressed in black trousers and a shirt that clung to her form. He stared for a moment. Felt his teeth with his tongue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What can I get for you?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A foreign girl, Eastern European.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond had been to Eastern Europe more than once. Even before the Soviets lost their hold. He had tasted many things there. Things few men ever taste.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to reply, but his throat and his tongue would not obey. Sweat tingled on his cheek. Something pulsed inside his skull.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; the girl asked. &#x201c;Do you need help?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Whiskey,&#x201d; he said, his voice crackling in his throat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hesitated, a thin line between her eyebrows. &#x201c;Bush, Jameson, Jack Daniel&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Black Bush,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A double, no water.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She fetched him the drink, served it in a tumbler. The liquidglowed amber, swaying in the glass as it clinked on the bar top.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shrill thought sounded in his mind, causing a moment of giddy panic. Had he brought any money? Raymond checked each pocket in turn, the fear building in him, until his fingers touched leather at his hip. He opened the wallet, sighed when he found<br>a twenty-pound note, and handed it over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Keep . . .&#x201d; His lungs betrayed him. He inhaled as much air as they would hold. &#x201c;Keep the change.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A smile flashed on her face, then was swept aside by concern. &#x201c;Are you sick?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Do you need a doctor?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond shook his head, no breath to spare. He took the glass to the farthest table, pausing on the way to let another dizzy wave pass. Raising the tumbler, he smelled warm earthy peat, sweet caramel, spice. Heat in his throat, the aftertaste of aniseed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he sat sipping at the whiskey, a knot of pain tightened around his left arm. It travelled up through his shoulder and neck before hammering on the inside of his skull. He held the table&#x2019;s edge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not here. Not here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond downed the rest of the whiskey in one gulp, coughed, and marvelled at the constellations that flowered across his vision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl approached. &#x201c;Sir? I can call a doctor.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shook his head, stood, made for the exit, carried more by his momentum than his legs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, he went to the towpath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too close to the pub and the houses. Half a mile downriver, past the boat club, the buildings would recede, nothing but grass and trees along the river&#x2019;s edge. He had walked the towpath many times, letting the quiet air enshroud him, the calm seeping in through his pores.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another charge of pain coursed from his arm up to his brain, stronger than before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walk. Jesus Christ, walk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His legs obeyed. Time bent and cracked around him. Grey turned to green. Civilisation faded into the distance, only the rough ground and the sound of the wind through leaves. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman and a dog. It sniffed at him as he passed, whined, smelling the death on him. His and that of the others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cyclist, wrapped in Lycra, a helmet on his head, skidding to avoid a collision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fuck&#x2019;s sake, watch where you&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; the cyclist shouted as he pedalled away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond did not answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stepped off the gravel path, toward the grass and weeds at the edge. His shoes sank in the wetness. Hard, needling cold swamping his feet. The river flowed past, fat from the rainfall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;God, let it be now,&#x201d; Raymond said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed at the futility of his prayer. He and God had parted ways half a lifetime ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dug his fingers into his pocket, the tips already going numb. His keys snagged on a thread. He pulled harder, and they came free. It took the last of his strength to toss them six feet. They splashed in the water without a sound. At least none that he could hear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another shock of pain, bigger than his body could hold, raging up through his left arm, his shoulder, his neck, then an explosion in his brain like the birth of a star.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water came to meet him, swallowed him, as tender as it was cold. A million images streaked through Raymond&#x2019;s mind, each one as bold and brilliant as the last, faces he&#x2019;d known, many he hadn&#x2019;t, some of them twisted in terror.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sparked and fell like the scatterings of a firework, falling into black, down to where the fire awaited him. Down into the final silence.<br><b>2</b><br>Rea Carlisle sat on the stairs, looking at the black plastic bags, a man&#x2019;s life wrapped up and ready to be dumped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hadn&#x2019;t seen her uncle for twenty-eight years, and she remembered the occasion better than the man. She had been six years old, a funeral in a draughty church whose location she could not recall. People had whispered, asking what her mother was doing bringing a child that age to a funeral? The babysitter hadn&#x2019;t turned up, and Rea&#x2019;s mother had scrubbed her face with spit and tissue before bundling her into her best Sunday school dress and dragging her out to the car.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Raymond had stood quiet and still throughout, had smiled and shaken hands with people who seemed to be as strange to him as they were to Rea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother embraced him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Och, Raymond, I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His arms remained by his sides, his back stiff and straight. &#x201c;Thanks for coming, Ida,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they put his wife in the ground, Uncle Raymond brought a finger to his eye. But there was no tear to wipe away. Even though Rea could recall only the most vague image of his face, she remembered clearly how silly the action of wiping away a non-existent tear seemed to her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked her mother about it on the drive home in the Mini Metro.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida stayed quiet for a while, watching the road ahead. Then she said, &#x201c;Well, he was always an odd cratur.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, they never talked much about him. Rea knew her mother had tried to contact Raymond, by telephone, by letter, but never a reply. He faded from their lives like mist from a window.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone call had come a week ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rea had been sitting at her kitchen table, eating a microwaved ready meal straight from the plastic container, scrolling through the listings of a jobs website on her iPad. She lifted her mobile knowing it would be her mother&#x2019;s name on the display. Ida had a knack of calling at awkward moments. When Rea was eating, or in the bath, or on the toilet, or trying to get out the door, she could almost guarantee the phone would ring.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Raymond,&#x201d; Ida said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rea&#x2019;s mind scrambled to connect the name to anyone she knew. God help her, she didn&#x2019;t want another one of those verbal tennis matches where her mother insisted Rea knew someone while Rea swore blind she didn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Och, you know him surely, Ida would say.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t, Rea would counter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Och, you do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I don&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back and forth until Rea would be ready to scream.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before any of that could happen, Ida said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rea heard a watery sigh in the phone&#x2019;s earpiece.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Raymond,&#x201d; Ida said, exasperation in her voice. &#x201c;Your uncle Raymond. My brother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white wisp of a man by the graveside came back to her. The finger at the dry eye. The features she could not form into a real face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Rea said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ida tutted at the minor blasphemy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Rea said, not meaning it. &#x201c;How did he die?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not sure,&#x201d; Ida said. &#x201c;Maybe drowned, but they don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Drowned?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He was found in the Lagan yesterday afternoon, all snagged up in the weeds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rea heard a crack in her mother&#x2019;s voice. A sharp, high-pitched inhalation. She pictured a tissue screwed up in Ida&#x2019;s fingers, ready to dab at her cheeks. Keeping it all bound up tight like a ball of string in her breast in case she made a show of herself. Ida Carlisle was the kind of woman who wept at her kitchen table, a cup of tea going cold in front of her, at least one closed door between her and anyone else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They found out who he was from his wallet,&#x201d; Ida said. &#x201c;It took them a day to find out he was related to me. The police called at the house this evening.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Was Dad there?&#x201d; Rea asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, he was at a party meeting.

Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life - whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money or a possession, health or spirital peace of mind. And the maze is where you look for what you want - the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in. This profound book from bestselling author, Spencer Johnson, will show you how to anticipate change, adapt to change quickly, enjoy change and be ready to change quickly again and again. Discover the secret for yourself and learn how to deal with change, so that you suffer from less stress and enjoy more success in your work and in life. Written for all ages, this story takes less than an hour to read, but its unique insights can last for a lifetime.</p><p>Change can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. The message of <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i> is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives. <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i> is a parable that takes place in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice--nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are "littlepeople," mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image. Their lives and belief systems are built around the cheese they've found. Most of us reading the story will see the cheese as something related to our livelihoods--our jobs, our career paths, the industries we work in--although it can stand for anything, from health to relationships. The point of the story is that we have to be alert to changes in the cheese, and be prepared to go running off in search of new sources of cheese when the cheese we have runs out.<p> Dr.&nbsp;Johnson, coauthor of <i>The One Minute Manager</i> and many other books, presents this parable to business, church groups, schools, military organizations--anyplace where you find people who may fear or resist change. And although more analytical and skeptical readers may find the tale a little too simplistic, its beauty is that it sums up all natural history in just 94 pages: Things change. They always have changed and always will change. And while there's no single way to deal with change, the consequence of pretending change won't happen is always the same: The cheese runs out. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Spencer Johnson, MD, is one of the world&#39;s leading authors of inspirational writing. He has written many New York Times bestsellers, including the worldwide phenomenon Who Moved My Cheese? and, with Kenneth Blanchard, The One Minute Manager. His works have become cultural touchstones and are available in 40 languages.</p><h2>Life of Fred Advanced Algebra Expanded Edition</h2><p>ife of Fred is a series of math books that break the old pattern of drill and kill.

Reissue.</p><p>For genteel pleasures of a teatime whodunit, I recommended Margaret Maron's wellmannered Southern mysteries. The stories are served with a buttery regional flavor and Deborah Knott, a North Carolina district court judge, presides over them like a proper hostess dispensing good judgment in child-custody case of two drunken hunters who have shot up a discarded truck tire, thinking they had bagged an alligator. And she tempers it all with kindness. "I am always drawn to faces that seem to look on human folly with compassion and amusement," she says in KILLER MARKET. <p>Making the country circuit, the judge pays a court call on High Point, a Piedmont mill town whose population doubles when 70,000 visitors converge for a week of serious trading at the International Home Furnishings Market. Unable to find a hotel room, Deborah attaches herself to local friends, has an Alice-in-Wonderland encounter with a dotty furniture designer and discovers the expiring body of an industry executive swinging on a piece of "motion" furniture. Maron makes a full inside sweep of this vast trade show, but the real attraction is her polished style, high-gloss combination of original observations and clever turns of phrase.</p>MARGARET MARON grew up on a farm near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she returned to her North Carolina roots with her artist-husband, Joe, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, Bootlegger's Daughter, became a Washington Post best-seller that swept the major mystery awards for its year and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels Up Jumps the Devil, Storm Track, and Three-Day Town each won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the state's highest civilian honor. And in 2013, The Mystery Writers of America celebrated Maron's contributions to the mystery genre by naming her a Grand Master-an honor first bestowed on Agatha Christie. In 2016, she was inducted into the North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame. To find out more about the author, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.

As Wallace, often under conditions of terrible hardship and sickness, battles through jungles, lives with headhunters, and collects beetles, butterflies and birds-of-paradise, he makes discoveries about the workings of biology that have shaped our view of the world ever since.</p><p>Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) was one of the most important and likeable British scientists of the 19th century. A field researcher of genius, he spent many years in Brazil and southeast Asia, identifying many new species and, independently of Darwin, before developing - in parallel to Darwin - the theory of evolution through natural selection. He effectively created the whole field of &#39;bio-geography&#39;, with the great split between Eurasian and Australasian flora and fauna, which runs through the Malay archipelago, now named the Wallace Line. His research on warning colouration and speciation continues to shape modern research.One of the most adventurous, observant and honourable scientists of his time -- Sir David Attenborough</p><h2>Book by Book: Notes on Reading and Life</h2><p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning critic's often surprising meditation on those places where life and books intersect and what might be learned from both<br><br>Once out of school, most of us read for pleasure.Yet there is another equally important, though often overlooked, reason that we read: to learn how to live. Though books have always been understood as life-teachers, the exact way in which they instruct, cajole, and convince remains a subject of some mystery. Drawing on sources as diverse as Dr. Seuss and Simone Weil, P. G. Wodehouse and Isaiah Berlin, Pulitzer prize-winning critic Michael Dirda shows how the wit, wisdom, and enchantment of the written word can inform and enrich nearly every aspect of life, from education and work to love and death. <br><br>Organized by significant life events and abounding with quotations from great writers and thinkers, <i>Book by Book</i> showcases Dirda's considerable knowledge, which he wears lightly. Favoring showing rather than telling, Dirda draws the reader deeper into the classics, as well as lesser-known works of literature, history, and philosophy, always with an eye to what is relevant to how we might better understand our lives. <br><br></p><p>Michael Dirda, a longtime staff writer for <i>The Washington Post Book World</i>, received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for criticism.

Storytelling has always enchanted me, and early on I found myself reading just about anything that came my way, from Green Lantern comics to the great classics of world literature. My memoir, An Open Book, recounts a young life unexpectedly shaped by this omnivorous and indiscriminate reading.

Despite all these hours of turning pages, I don't view myself as a bookworm, one of those bald-pated Daumier scarecrows peering through bottle-top spectacles at some tattered, leather-bound volume. There's more to life than reading. I've also fallen in love and married, spent Saturdays ferrying noisy offspring to soccer games, mowed grass, folded laundry, and suffered my share of what Shakespeare called "the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to."<br>&nbsp;<br>A normal enough life, then. Yet even as a kid back in working-class Lorain, Ohio, I decided that what I wanted most of all was--how shall I put this?--to feel at home in the world, which meant to know something of the best that has been thought, believed, and created by the great minds of the past and present.<br>&nbsp;<br>In some ways, that ambition must sound odd, even slightly romantic. But let me explain. About the age of twelve or thirteen, I grew enamored of the story of the Count of Monte Cristo. Suave, cosmopolitan, wealthy, charismatic, the count actually starts life as a naive young sailor named Edmond Dant�s, betrayed by those he trusted and imprisoned on the Ch�teau d'If for a crime he never committed. At first he despairs. But one day he hears a quiet scraping noise coming from inside his cell wall--tunneling--and in due course meets the learned Abb� Faria, who eventually teaches him everything an accomplished man of the world should know. The young sailor studies, practices, learns, remembers. And so when, after many years, he is finally able to escape and seek a reckoning with those who wronged him, Edmond Dant�s has transformed himself into the urbane and accomplished Count of Monte Cristo.<br>&nbsp;<br>Alexandre Dumas's novel remains a great parable about the power of learning and education and calls to mind one of our most fundamental American convictions: that any of us may, through hard work, fashion a new and better life for himself. As Henry David Thoreau long ago observed, "If a man advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."<br>&nbsp;<br>In childhood and early youth most of us naturally read for escape, pleasure, and inspiration; as young adults we use our school texts to learn a profession or trade; and then as full-fledged grown-ups we add yet another, perhaps deeper purpose to our reading: We turn to books in the hope of better understanding our selves and better engaging with the meaning of our experiences. Let me say, right off, that I believe a work of art is primarily concerned with the creation of beauty, whether through words, colors, shapes, sounds, or movement. But it is impossible to read serious novels, poetry, essays, and biographies without also growing convinced that they gradually enlarge our minds, refine our spirits, make us more sensitive and understanding. In this way, the humanities encourage the development of our own humanity. They are instruments of self-exploration.<br>&nbsp;<br>For Book by Book, I've set down some of what I've learned about life from my reading. In its character the result is a florilegium: a "bouquet" of insightful or provocative quotations from favorite authors, surrounded by some of my own observations, several lists, the occasional anecdote, and a series of mini-essays on aspects of life, love, work, education, art, the self, death. There's even, occasionally, a bit of out-and-out advice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Though my emphasis clearly remains on books as life-teachers, readers searching for any definitive answers or gurulike pronouncements won't find them here. Soon enough one learns that there are no straightforward solutions to most of life's perplexities. Great fiction, in particular, eschews the reductionist and obviously didactic, instead reveling in complication, pointing out options, at most revealing the consequences of one course of action over another. Contradiction, not consistency, second thoughts, rather than dogmatic certitude, lie at the heart of humane understanding, and all those who try to simplify experience usually only succeed in narrowing it. To my mind, life should be complex, packed with questioning, full of misdirection and wasted effort--a certain number of mistakes is, after all, the price for "living large." Arthur Schnabel remains the nonpareil interpreter of Beethoven's piano sonatas, yet he made occasional fumbles in his fingering. But to play such music as it should be played required the pianist to push himself to his limits. Schnabel's motto was that of all great souls: "Safety last."<br>&nbsp;<br>As I assembled these pages, my intention was to produce a book that could stand, however sheepishly, on the same shelf as Cyril Connolly's The Unquiet Grave, Robertson Davies's A Voice from the Attic, and W. H. Auden's A Certain World. Above all, I hope the result is, to echo the poet Horace's old formula, dulce et utile--enjoyable and useful--a book to read slowly, to browse in, and return to.<br>&nbsp;<br>For just this reason you might want to keep a pencil nearby to mark favorite quotations or to scribble in the margins and on the endpapers. These are the sort of pages that demand to be "personalized," amplified, and enriched with your own reflections, made uniquely yours. Perhaps Book by Book may even encourage you to start creating a reader's guide of your own.<br>&nbsp;<br>N.B.--Some of the authors cited use the generic "man" or the pronoun "he" to refer to the totality of humankind. The female half of the population will, I trust, make allowances for this largely outmoded convention.<br>&nbsp;<br>Quotations are usually identified simply by author; uncredited material is my own.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2005 by Michael Dirda</p><h2>Healthy Calendar Diabetic Cooking: A Full Year of Delicious Menus and Easy Recipes</h2><p>Fully revised and better then ever, this new edition of <i>Healthy Calendar Diabetic Cooking</i> is packed with new recipes to give cooks with diabetes over a year of delicious, diabetes-friendly meals.

Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker--a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction--into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist--but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life. <br> Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, "The Signature of All Things" soars across the globe--from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who--born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution--bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert's wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers. <p></p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013: </strong>As a small girl, Elizabeth Gilbert scrawled her name in the most extraordinary book in her house: an original illustrated folio of Captain Cook&#x2019;s voyages. Decades later, her parents discovered her signature and gave her the book, reigniting her passion for scientific exploration in the century leading up to Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution. She became fascinated with the women&#x2014;always wives or daughters of scientists&#x2014;who made their own discoveries, in spite of the cultural constraints that kept them from true exploration. Her invented heroine, the insatiably curious Alma Whittaker, daughter of a scrappy botanical baron, spends most of her life confined to her family estate in Philadelphia, yearning for a life of greater passion and liberty. She channels her desires into botany, thrilling to the miniature universe of moss in the forests surrounding her house, developing a new taxonomy that becomes a theory encompassing all living things, parallel to Darwin&#x2019;s. When she finally turns herself loose on the world, it&#x2019;s to claim her place in a lineage of explorers. An earthy, elegant, deeply sensual novel of daring breadth and imagination, <em>The Signature of All Things</em> gives us the cosmos in the life of one woman, in her worlds within worlds. <em>&#x2013;Mari Malcolm</em>Elizabeth Gilbert is an award-winning writer of both fiction and nonfiction.

Least of all Chevy Chase.</p><p>It was February 18, 1978, another ice-cold evening in New York, which had just endured its most ferocious blizzard in thirty years. The three-day nor&#x2019;easter, dubbed &#x201c;Storm Larry,&#x201d; had closed schools the previous week, and Central Park remained blanketed by snow. Many chose to stay home that night. Outside 30 Rockefeller Plaza in midtown Manhattan, however, a long line of people waited patiently, stamping their feet and rubbing their hands. After all, freezing weather was well worth braving in order to catch an episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, on a Saturday night, live.</p><p>Eight floors up in the Art Deco skyscraper, throughout the corridors behind Studio 8H, there was a chill in the air that had nothing to do with snow. The incredibly popular comedy troupe known as the Not Ready for Prime-Time Players were busy prepping for their next big night, the eleventh show of season three. Dan Aykroyd was getting into the zone for his first sketch, a typically demented number about a salesman pitching a device for crushing moths. John Belushi was stomping through the halls like a buffalo, as always seemingly free of nerves. New boy Bill Murray, who&#x2019;d had a shaky start, even receiving hate mail from viewers, was practicing his New England accent. Later that night he&#x2019;d be playing Bobby Kennedy in a silly &#x201c;chow-dah&#x201d;&#x2013; packed bit about JFK and RFK trying to bug the home of Martin Luther King.</p><p>And then there was Chevy.</p><p>Suave, handsome, and pumped up with braggadocio, Cornelius &#x201c;Chevy&#x201d; Chase had been the first <i>SNL </i>star to really hit it big. In 1975, the cover of <i>New York Magazine </i>had proclaimed him &#x201c;The Funniest Man in America.&#x201d; The general consensus was that he agreed. He had come to dominate the first year of the show, introducing every episode but one, smirking his self-created catchphrase&#x2014;&#x201c;Good evening. I&#x2019;m Chevy Chase, and you&#x2019;re not&#x201d;&#x2014;pratfalling up a storm, and playing the Landshark, a <i>Jaws</i>-riffing oceanic predator who targets sexy women.</p><p>Then, he had disappeared. Officially, his reason for quitting midway through season 2 was a new relationship. His girlfriend Jacqueline Carlin, Chase explained, didn&#x2019;t want to move to New York. But his fellow comedians felt he&#x2019;d deserted them, heading for L.A. and a slew of movie offers. Especially after staff writer Tom Davis reported back to them what Chase had provided as his reason for leaving: &#x201c;Money. Lots of money.&#x201d;</p><p>So Chase&#x2019;s return to <i>SNL</i>, this time as guest host, was leaving a bad taste in the collective&#x2019;s mouth. As the cast spent Monday to Friday honing the Chevy-heavy series of skits&#x2014;as well as spouting nonsense as &#x201c;The Reverend Archbishop Maharishi O&#x2019;Mulliganstein DDS of the Church of Confusion,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d be reprising his signature character, President Gerald Ford&#x2014;there was much whispering behind his back, especially by Belushi.</p><p>The week almost passed without incident. But on Saturday night, shortly after eleven p.m., it all came to a head. Chase was en route to the stage for the cold open, clad in his classic Ford costume: suit, tie, brown leather shoes. Not long earlier, Murray had needled him as the two men had makeup applied; now, when Chase stuck his head into the dressing room where Murray and Belushi were sitting on a sofa, the exchange was even spikier.</p><p>&#x201c;There was no love lost between those guys,&#x201d; says comedian Dave Thomas, who was there visiting Aykroyd. &#x201c;Especially at that time, when it was fueled by extreme competitiveness, alcohol, drugs, and fame. Who&#x2019;s the most famous? Who&#x2019;s the funniest? Who&#x2019;s the best? I still think what happened that night could have been avoided, but Chevy is a provocateur. Chevy says things that make people angry.&#x201d;</p><p>To the shock of everyone in the vicinity, the conversation between the three men suddenly escalated into hand-to-hand combat. Murray lunged forward at Chase, a mad glint in his eye, his fist connecting with his opponent&#x2019;s famous face.</p><p>&#x201c;It was a huge altercation,&#x201d; says director John Landis, another eyewitness to the melee. &#x201c;They were big guys and really going at it. They were slapping at each other, screaming at each other, calling each other terrible names. The best insult, which made a huge impression on me, was by Bill. In the heat of anger, he pointed at Chevy and yelled, &#x2018;MEDIUM TALENT!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Murray remembers it differently. &#x201c;It was really a Hollywood fight; a don&#x2019;t-touch-my-face kinda thing,&#x201d; he shrugs. &#x201c;Chevy is a big man, I&#x2019;m not a small guy, and we were separated by my brother Brian, who comes up to my chest. So it was kind of a non-event. It was just the significance of it. It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because we all felt mad he had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>The intensity of the blows alters from account to account. But the quality of the verbal burns, as the two future titans of comedy went at each other like hissing street cats, remains consistent.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna land Neil Armstrong on your face if you don&#x2019;t shut up,&#x201d; snarled Chase, targeting his enemy&#x2019;s acne-scarred skin.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go fuck your wife<i>?&#x201d;</i> Murray hit back, implying that Chase&#x2019;s spouse wasn&#x2019;t getting much action at home.</p><p>And then it was all over, the pair pulled apart and Chase dispatched to begin the show.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a great story, the stuff of legend. But it&#x2019;s more than that. This moment marked the beginnings of a decade-long duel between two of the most bankable stars of the 1980s. Murray and Chase were about to be unleashed on the world in a major way, with towering triumphs and colossal defeats ahead of them both. And they weren&#x2019;t alone. Many of the alumni of <i>SNL</i>, as well as its Canadian equivalent <i>SCTV </i>(<i>Second City Television</i>), would soon burst onto the Hollywood scene, competing with one another, collaborating with one another and creating hilarious, box-office-smashing movies in the process.</p><p>Most of them would prosper. Some would fade away. A few would destroy themselves. But as a combined force they would bring about a new golden age of comedy. And there was nothing &#x201c;medium talent&#x201d; about it.</p></p><h2>The Certified Six Sigma Green Belt Handbook, 2nd Edition (With 2 CD-ROMs) Hardcover &#x2013; 2015 - International Edition</h2><p>Please READ DESCRIPTION Before Buying.

We live at a time of runaway growth in human numbers, consumption, and technology. The great question we now face is how, and whether, this can go on. Ronald Wright argues that our modern predicament, though new in scale, is as old as humankind.<br><i>A Short History of Progress</i> is nothing less than a concise history of the world since Neanderthal times, elegantly written, brilliantly conceived, and stunningly clear in its warming to us now. Wright shows how human beings have a way of walking into "progress traps," beginning with the worldwide slaughter of big game in the Stone Age. The same pattern of overconsumption then took a new form as many of the world's most creative civilizations--Mesopotamia, the Maya, the Roman Empire--fell victim to their own success. <br><br>Only by understanding our pattern of progress and disaster, Wright contends, can we hope to change our ways and ensure that civilization has a longterm future.<br><b>"[Ronald Wright] is an historical philosopher with a profound understanding of other cultures."--Jan Morris</b><br><b>"A wise, timely, and brilliant book."--Toronto <i>Globe and Mail</i></b><br></p><p>No hope, just an awareness of what's being done now and what's been done in the past, is what Ronald Wright will permit in <i>A Short History of Progress</i>, his grim, ammoniacal Massey Lectures, the 43rd in the series. In five lucid, meticulously documented essays, Wright traces the rise and plummet of four regional civilizations--those of Sumer, Rome, Easter Island, and the Maya--and judges that most, perhaps all, of humanity is making and will continue to make mistakes equally disastrous as theirs. He gives general reasons first for not reckoning we'll pull back from the brink. Important among them is an anthropological observation. As individuals, we live long lives. We evolve more slowly than we should, given our lack of vision and our aggressive, selfish nature. We seem to lack the collective wisdom and the insight into cause and effect to realize the limits to what Wright calls the "experiment" of civilization. What Wright calls natural "subsidies" underwrite civilizations' successes. The squandering of those gifts presages inevitable failure, but with careful, canny stewardship, a civilization can manage to muddle through eons. Wright cites Egypt's submission to the limits set by the Nile's annual floods and China's windblown "lump-sum deposit" of topsoil, used for hillside paddies instead of being put to the plough. Wright observes with unrelenting eloquence that our planetary civilization lives precariously, far beyond its means. "Hope drives us to invent new fixes for old messes," he acknowledges, neither claiming nor wanting to be a prophet. We certainly have the tools for change and remediation; we also know what our ancestors did wrong and what happened to them. We're faced, our author observes, with two choices: either do nothing--what he calls "one of the biggest mistakes"--or try to effect "the transition from short-term to long-term thinking." His evidence suggests we're taking the first alternative, which will include a swift, final ride into the dark future on the runaway train of progress. Wright's account tempts one to bet on the rats and roaches. <i>--Ted Whittaker</i><b>Ronald Wright</b> is an award-winning novelist, historian, and essayist.

Now the &#34;compulsively readable&#34; (Publishers Weekly) John Connolly confirms his position as one of our leading crime novelists with a story of superb menace and style. The body of Grace Peltier, a brilliant Ph.D. candidate, is found in the front seat of her car on a back road in northern Maine. No one wants to believe it was suicide -- not her father, not former U.S. senator Jack Mercier, and not private detective Charlie Parker, who has been hired to investigate the young woman&#39;s untimely death. But when a mass grave is accidentally discovered nearby, revealing the grim truth behind the disappearance of a religious community known as the Aroostook Baptists, Parker realizes that their deaths and the violent passing of Grace Peltier are part of the same mystery, one that has its roots in her family history and in the origins of the shadowy organization known as the Fellowship. Soon Parker is drawn into the dark world of this zealous religious group that has already consumed every person who has dared confront it. When a relic is discovered, one capable of linking the Fellowship to the slaughter of the Aroostook Baptists, Parker is forced into violent conflict with the Fellowship and its enigmatic leader. Haunted by the ghost of a small boy and tormented by the demonic killer known as Mr. Pudd, Parker is forced to fight for his lover, his friends...and his very soul. &#34;This is a honeycomb world. It hides a hollow heart,&#34; writes John Connolly. In The Killing Kind, he has once again created a world of love and hate, of tenderness and violence. Hailed by critics as &#34;one of the best of the genre&#34; (Toronto Sun), his intense, poetic prose and his terrifying clan of characters are sure to thrill even the most discerning suspense reader.</p><p><b>John Connolly</b> is the author of <i>Every Dead Thing</i> and <i>Dark Hollow.</i> He is a regular contributor to <i>The Irish Times</i> and lives in Dublin, Ireland.

The scarlets of the red maples were dominant, but they were being joined now by the greenish yellow leaves of the red oaks; the silver of the bigtooth aspens; and the greens of the quaking aspens, the birches, and the beeches. Poplars and willows, elms and hazelnuts were all bursting into full bloom, and the woods were ringing with the noise of returning birds. </p><p> I could see the woods from the gym at One City Center, the tips of the evergreens still dominating the landscape amid the slowly transforming seasonals. Rain was falling on the streets of Portland and umbrellas swarmed on the streets below, glistening darkly like the carapaces of squat black beetles. </p><p> For the first time in many months, I felt good. I was in semiregular employment. I was eating well, working out three or four days each week, and Rachel Wolfe was coming up from Boston for the weekend, so I would have someone to admire my improving physique. I hadn't suffered bad dreams for some time. My dead wife and my lost daughter had not appeared to me since the previous Christmas, when they touched me amid the falling snow and gave me some respite from the visions that had haunted me for so long. </p><p> I completed a set of military presses and laid the bar down, sweat dripping from my nose and rising in little wisps of steam from my body. Seated on a bench, sipping some water, I watched the two men enter from the reception area, glance around, then fix on me. They wore conservative dark suits with somber ties. One was large, with brown wavy hair and a thick mustache, like a porn star gone to seed, the bulge of the gun in the cheap rig beneath his jacket visible to me in the mirror behind him. The other was smaller, a tidy, dapper man with receding, prematurely graying hair. The big man held a pair of shades in his hand while his companion wore a pair of gold-rimmed eyeglasses with square frames. He smiled as he approached me. </p><p> "Mr. Parker?" he asked, his hands clasped behind his back. </p><p> I nodded and the hands disengaged, the right extending toward me in a sharp motion like a shark making its way through familiar waters. </p><p> "My name is Quentin Harrold, Mr. Parker," he said. "I work for Mr. Jack Mercier." </p><p> I wiped my own right hand on a towel to remove some of the sweat, then accepted the handshake. Harrold's mouth quivered a little as my still sweaty palm gripped his, but he resisted the temptation to wipe his hand clean on the side of his trousers. I guessed that he didn't want to spoil the crease. </p><p> Jack Mercier came from money so old that some of it had jangled on the Mayflower. He was a former U.S. senator, as his father and grandfather had been before him, and lived in a big house out on Prouts Neck overlooking the sea. He had interests in timber companies, newspaper publishing, cable television, software, and the Internet. In fact, he had interests in just about anything that might ensure the Merciers' old money was regularly replenished with injections of new money. As a senator he had been something of a liberal and he still supported various ecological and civil rights groups through generous donations. He was a family man; he didn't screw around -- as far as anyone knew -- and he had emerged from his brief flirtation with politics with his reputation enhanced rather than tarnished, a product as much of his financial independence as of any moral probity. There were rumors that he was planning a return to politics, possibly as an independent candidate for governor, although Mercier himself had yet to confirm them. </p><p> Quentin Harrold coughed into his palm, then used it as an excuse to take a handkerchief from his pocket and discreetly wipe his hand. "Mr. Mercier would like to see you," he said, in the tone of voice he probably reserved for the pool cleaner and the chauffeur. "He has some work for you." </p><p> I looked at him. He smiled. I smiled back. We stayed like that, grinning at each other, until the only options were to speak or start dating. Harrold took the first option. </p><p> "Perhaps you didn't hear me, Mr. Parker," he said. "Mr. Mercier has some work for you." </p><p> "And?" </p><p> Harrold's smile wavered. "I'm not sure what you mean." </p><p> "I'm not so desperate for work, Mr. Harrold, that I run and fetch every time somebody throws a stick." This wasn't entirely true. Portland, Maine, wasn't such a wellspring of vice and corruption that I could afford to look down my nose at too many jobs. If Harrold had been better looking and a different sex, I'd have fetched the stick and then rolled onto my back to have my belly rubbed if I thought it might have earned me more than a couple of bucks. </p><p> Harrold glanced at the big guy with the mustache. The big guy shrugged, then went back to staring at me impassively, maybe trying to figure out what my head would look like mounted over his fireplace. </p><p> Harrold coughed again. "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to offend you." He seemed to have trouble forming the words, as if they were part of someone else's vocabulary and he was just borrowing them for a time. I waited for his nose to start growing or his tongue to turn to ash and fall to the floor, but nothing happened. "We'd be grateful if you'd spare the time to talk to Mr. Mercier," he conceded with a wince. </p><p> I figured that I'd played hard to get for long enough, although I still wasn't sure that they'd respect me in the morning. "When I've finished up here, I can probably drive out and see him," I said. </p><p> Harrold craned his neck slightly, indicating that he believed he might have misheard me. "Mr. Mercier was hoping that you could come with us now, Mr. Parker. Mr. Mercier is a very busy man, as I'm sure you'll understand." </p><p> I stood up, stretched, and prepared to do another set of presses. "Oh, I understand, Mr. Harrold. I'll be as quick as I can. Why don't you gentlemen wait downstairs, and I'll join you when I'm done? You're making me nervous. I might drop a weight on you." </p><p> Harrold shifted on his feet for a moment, then nodded. </p><p> "We'll be in the lobby," he said. </p><p> "Enjoy," I replied, then watched them in the mirror as they walked away. </p><p> I took my time finishing my workout, then had a long shower and talked about the future of the Pirates with the guy who was cleaning out the changing room. When I figured that Harrold and the porn star had spent enough time looking at their watches, I took the elevator down to the lobby and waited for them to join me. The expression on Harrold's face, I noticed, was oscillating between annoyance and relief. </p><p> Harrold insisted that I accompany him and his companion in their Mercedes, but despite their protests I opted to follow them in my own Mustang. It struck me that I was becoming more willfully perverse as I settled into my midthirties. If Harrold had told me to take my own car, I'd probably have chained myself to the steering column of the Mercedes until they agreed to give me a ride. </p><p> The Mustang was a 1969 Boss 302, and replaced the Mach 1 that had been shot to pieces the previous year. The 302 had been sourced for me by Willie Brew, who ran an auto shop down in Queens. The spoilers and wings were kind of over the top, but it made my eyes water when it accelerated and Willie had sold it to me for $8,000, which was about $3,000 less than a car in its condition was worth. The downside was that I might as well have had arrested adolescence painted on the side in big black letters. </p><p> I followed the Mercedes south out of Portland and on to U.S. 1. At Oak Hill, we turned east and I stayed behind them at a steady thirty all the way to the tip of the Neck. At the Black Point Inn, guests sat at the picture windows, staring out with drinks in their hands at Grand Beach and Pine Point. A Scarborough PD cruiser inched along the road, making sure that everybody stayed under thirty and nobody unwanted hung around long enough to spoil the view. </p><p> Jack Mercier had his home on Winslow Homer Road, within sight of the painter's former house. As we approached, an electronically operated barrier opened and a second Mercedes swept toward us from the house, headed for Black Point Road. In the backseat sat a small man with a dark beard and a skullcap on his head. We exchanged a look as the two cars passed each other, and he nodded at me. His face was familiar, I thought, but I couldn't place it. Then the road was clear and we continued on our way. </p><p> Mercier's home was a huge white place with landscaped gardens and so many rooms that a search party would have to be organized if anybody got lost on the way to the bathroom. The man with the mustache parked the Mercedes while I followed Harrold through the large double front doors, down the hallway, and into a room to the left of the main stairs. It was a library, furnished with antique couches and chairs. Books stretched to the ceiling on three walls; on the east-facing wall, a window looked out on the grounds and the sea beyond, a desk and chair beside it and a small bar to the right. </p><p> Harrold closed the door behind me and left me to examine the spines on the books and the photographs on the wall. The books ranged from political biographies to historical works, mainly examinations of the Civil War, Korea, and Vietnam. There was no fiction. In one corner was a small locked cabinet with a glass front. The books it contained were different from those on the open shelves. They had titles like <i>Myth and History in the Book of Revelation; Apocalypse and Millennium in English Romantic Poetry; The Book of Revelation: Apocalypse and Empire;</i> and <i>The Apocalyptic Sublime.</i> It was cheerful stuff: bedtime reading for the end of the world. There were also critical biographies of the artists William Blake, Albrecht Durer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and Jean Duvet, in addition to facsimile editions of what appeared to be medieval texts. Finally, on the top shelf were twelve almost identical slim volumes, each bound in black leather with six gold bands inset on the spine in three equidistant sets of two. At the base of each spine was the last letter of the Greek alphabet: W, for omega. There was no key in the lock, and the doors stayed closed when I gave them an experimental tug. </p><p> I turned my attention to the photographs on the walls. There were pictures of Jack Mercier with various Kennedys, Clintons, and even a superannuated Jimmy Carter. Others showed Mercier in an assortment of athletic poses from his youth: winning races, pretending to toss footballs, and being carried aloft on the shoulders of his adoring teammates. There were also testimonials from grateful universities, framed awards from charitable organizations headed by movie stars, and even some medals presented by poor but proud nations. It was like an underachiever's worst nightmare. </p><p> One more recent photograph caught my eye. It showed Mercier sitting at a table, flanked on one side by a woman in her sixties wearing a smartly tailored black jacket and a string of pearls around her neck. To Mercier's right was the bearded man who had passed me in the Mercedes, and beside him was a figure I recognized from his appearances on prime-time news shows, usually looking triumphant at the top of some courthouse steps: Warren Ober, of Ober, Thayer &amp; Moss, one of New England's top law firms. Ober was Mercier's attorney, and even the mention of his name was enough to send most opposition running for the hills. When Ober, Thayer &amp; Moss took a case, they brought so many lawyers with them to court that there was barely enough room for the jury. Even judges got nervous around them. </p><p> Looking at the photograph, it struck me that nobody in it seemed particularly happy. There was an air of tension about the poses, a sense that some darker business was being conducted and the photographer was an unnecessary distraction. There were thick files on the table before them, and white coffee cups lay discarded like yesterday's roses. </p><p> Behind me the door opened and Jack Mercier entered, laying aside on the table a sheaf of papers speckled with bar charts and figures. He was tall, six-two or six-three, with shoulders that spoke of his athletic past and an expensive gold Rolex that indicated his present status as a very wealthy man. His hair was white and thick, swept back from a perma-tanned forehead over large blue eyes, a Roman nose, and a thin, smiling mouth, the teeth white and even. I guessed that he was sixty-five by now, maybe a little older. He wore a blue polo shirt, tan chinos, and brown Sebagos. There was white hair on his arms, and tufts of it peeked out over the collar of his shirt. For a moment the smile on his face faltered as he saw my attention focused on the photograph, but it quickly brightened again as I moved away from it. Meanwhile, Harrold stood at the door like a nervous matchmaker. </p><p> "Mr. Parker," said Mercier, shaking my hand with enough force to dislodge my fillings. "I appreciate you taking the time to see me." He waved me to a chair. From the hallway, an olive-skinned man in a white tunic appeared with a silver tray and set it down. Two china cups, a silver coffeepot, and a matching silver creamer and sugar bowl jangled softly as the tray hit the table. The tray looked heavy, and the servant seemed kind of relieved to be rid of it. </p><p> "Thank you," said Mercier. We watched as he left, Harrold behind him. Harrold gently closed the door, giving me one last pained look before he departed, then Mercier and I were alone. </p><p> "I know a lot about you, Mr. Parker," he began as he poured the coffee and offered me cream and sugar. He had an easy, unaffected manner, designed to put even the most fleeting of acquaintances at ease. It was so unaffected that he must have spent years perfecting it. </p><p> "Likewise," I replied. </p><p> He frowned good-naturedly. "I don't imagine you're old enough to have ever voted for me." </p><p> "No, you retired before it became an issue." </p><p> "Did your grandfather vote for me?" </p><p> My grandfather, Bob Warren, had been a Cumberland County sheriff's deputy and had lived in Scarborough all his life. My mother and I had come to stay with him after my father died. In the end, he outlived his own wife and daughter, and I had buried him one autumn day after his great heart failed him at last. </p><p> "I don't believe he ever voted for anyone, Mr. Mercier," I said. "My grandfather had a natural distrust of politicians." The only politician for whom my grandfather ever had any regard was President Zachary Taylor, who never voted in an election and didn't even vote for himself. </p><p> Jack Mercier grinned his big white grin again. "He might have been right. Most of them have sold their souls ten times over before they're even elected. Once it's sold, you can never buy it back. You just have to hope that you got the best price for it." </p><p> "And are you in the business of buying souls, Mr. Mercier, or selling them?" </p><p> The grin stayed fixed, but the eyes narrowed. "I take care of my own soul, Mr. Parker, and let other people do as they wish with theirs." </p><p> Our specia...</p></p><h2>Heinz Kohut: The Making of a Psychoanalyst</h2><p>Presents the biography of the American psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut.</p><p>Charles B. Stozier is a professor of history at John Jay College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, and a training and supervising psychoanalyst at the Training and Research Institute for Self Psychology (TRISP). He is the author of <i>Lincoln's Quest for Union: A Psychological Portrait and Apocalypse: On the Psychology of Fundamentalism in America</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Developments in psychoanalysis are, appropriately, often the products of half-discovered impulses and longings, so it's fitting that Kohut's The Analysis of the Self, which essentially invented and delineated relational psychoanalysis, was the product of many conflicting influences. This new, definitive biography not only records Kohut's illustrious career, but gives fresh insights and reflections upon his work. Born into a well-to-do Jewish family in Vienna in 1913, Kohut grew up with an intrusive mother, had an affair with his male tutor when he was 12, structured his sexual life around masochistic fantasies and studied to be a physician until he fled Austria in 1939 and moved to the U.S. Here, he became well known as a psychiatrist, and then as a psychoanalyst, reaching full bloom in 1971 with the publication of The Analysis of the Self. Strozier (Apocalypse: On the Psychology of Fundamentalism in America) has produced a sympathetic narrative of Kohut's life and work, but avoids the pitfalls of hagiography. He addresses Kohut's sexual ambivalence (including a close, lifelong friendship with conductor Robert Wadsworth) and his tormented relationship with his Jewishness, which ran so deep that Kohut was known to cause scenes in kosher restaurants by insisting on being served a ham sandwich and a glass of milk. Strozier navigates this complicated material with skill and sensitivity, never reducing his complex subject to a case study, in a work that will appeal to a small but dedicated audience. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Henri Matisse: A Retrospective</h2><p>Bound in publisher&#39;s original black cloth with the spine stamped in gilt.</p><p>Reproducing more than 400 artworks (320 in color), this hefty catalogue of an exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art documents the largest and most ambitious Matisse retrospective ever assembled. In his exciting introductory essay, MoMA curator Elderfield, who organized the exhibit, interprets the artist as a painter of metaphors, signs and analogies that pointed to an internal world of the imagination. No mere hedonist, Matisse mistrusted visual sensations and aimed at a mode of representation that had the clarity of a text, notes Elderfield, who brilliantly deconstructs the artist's pictorial language. Elderfield shows that the myth of a Golden Age, expressed in images of luxury and erotic fulfillment, is a key influence on a man who decisively altered the way we look at pictures. While the focus here is on painting, numerous drawings, sculptures, prints and stained-glass window designs are also reproduced. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mortuary Confidential: Undertakers Spill the Dirt</h2><p><i>When the casket reached the front of the sanctuary, there was a loud cracking sound as the bottom fell out.

"Social experience could become the object of pragmatic thought for the Greeks," he writes, "because in the city-state it lent itself to public debate.

Thus evolved a strictly political thought, separate from religion, with its own vocabulary, concepts, principles, and theoretical aims."</p></p><p>This Book is about the origins of Greek thought relates the cultural achievement of the ancient Greeks to their physical and social environment and shows that what they believed was inseparable from the way they lived.The late Jean-Pierre Vernant was Professor of Comparative Study of Religions at the College de France in Paris.</p><h2>KJV Outreach Bible (Softcover)</h2><p><p>Churches and ministries in search of an affordable, yet attractive, Bible for mass distribution will delight in this edition of the time-honored King James Version.</p><p>Conveniently sized, it offers a selection of materials that will help equip new Christians begin their walk with the Lord.<br>� Black letter<br>� Harmony of the Gospels<br>� Key Bible Promises<br>� How to Become a Christian</p><p><b>Sold as cases only (24/case)</b></p></p><p></p><h2>DMZ The Deluxe Edition Book One (DMZ (Deluxe))</h2><p>Collecting the first 12 issues of the series about the ultimate embedded war journalist trapped in a most unlikely war zone: the streets of New York City. &nbsp;<br><br>In the near future, America's worst nightmare has come true.

Retired now, he still wakes early and remembers how mornings used to be his favorite, as though the world were his secret, tires rumbling softly beneath him and the light emerging through the early fog, the brief sight of the bay off to his right, then the pines, tall and slender, and almost always he rode with the window partly open because he loved the smell of the pines and the heavy salt air, and in the winter he loved the smell of the cold. The pharmacy was a small two-story building attached to another building that housed separately a hardware store and a small grocery. Each morning Henry parked in the back by the large metal bins, and then entered the pharmacy&#x2019;s back door, and went about switching on the lights, turning up the thermostat, or, if it was summer, getting the fans going. He would open the safe, put money in the register, unlock the front door, wash his hands, put on his white lab coat. The ritual was pleasing, as though the old store&#x2014;with its shelves of toothpaste, vitamins, cosmetics, hair adornments, even sewing needles and greeting cards, as well as red rubber hot water bottles, enema pumps&#x2014;was a person altogether steady and steadfast. And any unpleasantness that may have occurred back in his home, any uneasiness at the way his wife often left their bed to wander through their home in the night&#x2019;s dark hours&#x2014;all this receded like a shoreline as he walked through the safety of his pharmacy. Standing in the back, with the drawers and rows of pills, Henry was cheerful when the phone began to ring, cheerful when Mrs. Merriman came for her blood pressure medicine, or old Cliff Mott arrived for his digitalis, cheerful when he prepared the Valium for Rachel Jones, whose husband ran off the night their baby was born. It was Henry&#x2019;s nature to listen, and many times during the week he would say, &#x201c;Gosh, I&#x2019;m awful sorry to hear that,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Say, isn&#x2019;t that something?&#x201d; Inwardly, he suffered the quiet trepidations of a man who had witnessed twice in childhood the nervous breakdowns of a mother who had otherwise cared for him with stridency. And so if, as rarely happened, a customer was distressed over a price, or irritated by the quality of an Ace bandage or ice pack, Henry did what he could to rectify things quickly. For many years Mrs. Granger worked for him; her husband was a lobster fisherman, and she seemed to carry with her the cold breeze of the open water, not so eager to please a wary customer. He had to listen with half an ear as he filled prescriptions, to make sure she was not at the cash register dismissing a complaint. More than once he was reminded of that same sensation in watching to see that his wife, Olive, did not bear down too hard on Christopher over a homework assignment or a chore left undone; that sense of his attention hovering&#x2014;the need to keep everyone content. When he heard a briskness in Mrs. Granger&#x2019;s voice, he would step down from his back post, moving toward the center of the store to talk with the customer himself. Otherwise, Mrs. Granger did her job well. He appreciated that she was not chatty, kept perfect inventory, and almost never called in sick. That she died in her sleep one night astonished him, and left him with some feeling of responsibility, as though he had missed, working alongside her for years, whatever symptom might have shown itself that he, handling his pills and syrups and syringes, could have fixed. &#x201c;Mousy,&#x201d; his wife said, when he hired the new girl. &#x201c;Looks just like a mouse.&#x201d; Denise Thibodeau had round cheeks, and small eyes that peeped through her brown-framed glasses. &#x201c;But a nice mouse,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;A cute one.&#x201d; &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s cute who can&#x2019;t stand up straight,&#x201d; Olive said. It was true that Denise&#x2019;s narrow shoulders sloped forward, as though apologizing for something. She was twenty-two, just out of the state university of Vermont. Her husband was also named Henry, and Henry Kitteridge, meeting Henry Thibodeau for the first time, was taken with what he saw as an unself-conscious excellence. The young man was vigorous and sturdy-featured with a light in his eye that seemed to lend a flickering resplendence to his decent, ordinary face. He was a plumber, working in a business owned by his uncle. He and Denise had been married one year. &#x201c;Not keen on it,&#x201d; Olive said, when he suggested they have the young couple to dinner. Henry let it drop. This was a time when his son&#x2014;not yet showing the physical signs of adolescence&#x2014;had become suddenly and strenuously sullen, his mood like a poison shot through the air, and Olive seemed as changed and changeable as Christopher, the two having fast and furious fights that became just as suddenly some blanket of silent intimacy where Henry, clueless, stupefied, would find himself to be the odd man out. But standing in the back parking lot at the end of a late summer day, while he spoke with Denise and Henry Thibodeau, and the sun tucked itself behind the spruce trees, Henry Kitteridge felt such a longing to be in the presence of this young couple, their faces turned to him with a diffident but eager interest as he recalled his own days at the university many years ago, that he said, &#x201c;Now, say. Olive and I would like you to come for supper soon.&#x201d; He drove home, past the tall pines, past the glimpse of the bay, and thought of the Thibodeaus driving the other way, to their trailer on the outskirts of town. He pictured the trailer, cozy and picked up&#x2014;for Denise was neat in her habits&#x2014;and imagined them sharing the news of their day. Denise might say, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an easy boss.&#x201d; And Henry might say, &#x201c;Oh, I like the guy a lot.&#x201d; He pulled into his driveway, which was not a driveway so much as a patch of lawn on top of the hill, and saw Olive in the garden. &#x201c;Hello, Olive,&#x201d; he said, walking to her. He wanted to put his arms around her, but she had a darkness that seemed to stand beside her like an acquaintance that would not go away. He told her the Thibodeaus were coming for supper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only right,&#x201d; he said. Olive wiped sweat from her upper lip, turned to rip up a clump of onion grass. &#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s that, Mr. President,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Give your order to the cook.&#x201d; On Friday night the couple followed him home, and the young Henry shook Olive&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Nice place here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;With that view of the water. Mr. Kitteridge says you two built this yourselves.&#x201d; &#x201c;Indeed, we did.&#x201d; Christopher sat sideways at the table, slumped in adolescent gracelessness, and did not respond when Henry Thibodeau asked him if he played any sports at school. Henry Kitteridge felt an unexpected fury sprout inside him; he wanted to shout at the boy, whose poor manners, he felt, revealed something unpleasant not expected to be found in the Kitteridge home. &#x201c;When you work in a pharmacy,&#x201d; Olive told Denise, setting before her a plate of baked beans, &#x201c;you learn the secrets of everyone in town.&#x201d; Olive sat down across from her, pushed forward a bottle of ketchup. &#x201c;Have to know to keep your mouth shut. But seems like you know how to do that.&#x201d; &#x201c;Denise understands,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. Denise&#x2019;s husband said, &#x201c;Oh, sure. You couldn&#x2019;t find someone more trustworthy than Denise.&#x201d; &#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; Henry said, passing the man a basket of rolls. &#x201c;And please. Call me Henry. One of my favorite names,&#x201d; he added. Denise laughed quietly; she liked him, he could see this. Christopher slumped farther into his seat. Henry Thibodeau&#x2019;s parents lived on a farm inland, and so the two Henrys discussed crops, and pole beans, and the corn not being as sweet this summer from the lack of rain, and how to get a good asparagus bed. &#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; said Olive, when, in passing the ketchup to the young man, Henry Kitteridge knocked it over, and ketchup lurched out like thickened blood across the oak table. Trying to pick up the bottle, he caused it to roll unsteadily, and ketchup ended up on his fingertips, then on his white shirt. &#x201c;Leave it,&#x201d; Olive commanded, standing up. &#x201c;Just leave it alone, Henry. For God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; And Henry Thibodeau, perhaps at the sound of his own name being spoken sharply, sat back, looking stricken. &#x201c;Gosh, what a mess I&#x2019;ve made,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. For dessert they were each handed a blue bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sliding in its center. &#x201c;Vanilla&#x2019;s my favorite,&#x201d; Denise said. &#x201c;Is it,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Mine, too,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. As autumn came, the mornings darker, and the pharmacy getting only a short sliver of the direct sun before it passed over the building and left the store lit by its own overhead lights, Henry stood in the back filling the small plastic bottles, answering the telephone, while Denise stayed up front near the cash register. At lunchtime, she unwrapped a sandwich she brought from home, and ate it in the back where the storage was, and then he would eat his lunch, and sometimes when there was no one in the store, they would linger with a cup of coffee bought from the grocer next door. Denise seemed a naturally quiet girl, but she was given to spurts of sudden talkativeness. &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s had MS for years, you know, so starting way back we all learned to help out. All three of my brothers are different. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s funny when it happens that way?&#x201d; The oldest brother, Denise said, straightening a bottle of shampoo, had been her father&#x2019;s favorite until he&#x2019;d married a girl her father didn&#x2019;t like. Her own in-laws were wonderful, she said. She&#x2019;d had a boyfriend before Henry, a Protestant, and his parents had not been so kind to her. &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t have worked out,&#x201d; she said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. &#x201c;Well, Henry&#x2019;s a terrific young man,&#x201d; Henry answered. She nodded, smiling through her glasses like a thirteen-year-old girl. Again, he pictured her trailer, the two of them like overgrown puppies tumbling together; he could not have said why this gave him the particular kind of happiness it did, like liquid gold being poured through him. She was as efficient as Mrs. Granger had been, but more relaxed. &#x201c;Right beneath the vitamins in the second aisle,&#x201d; she would tell a customer. &#x201c;Here, I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; Once, she told Henry she sometimes let a person wander around the store before asking if she could help them. &#x201c;That way, see, they might find something they didn&#x2019;t know they needed. And your sales will go up.&#x201d; A block of winter sun was splayed across the glass of the cosmetics shelf; a strip of wooden floor shone like honey. He raised his eyebrows appreciatively. &#x201c;Lucky for me, Denise, when you came through that door.&#x201d; She pushed up her glasses with the back of her hand, then ran the duster over the ointment jars. Jerry McCarthy, the boy who delivered the pharmaceuticals once a week from Portland&#x2014;or more often if needed&#x2014;would sometimes have his lunch in the back room. He was eighteen, right out of high school; a big, fat kid with a smooth face, who perspired so much that splotches of his shirt would be wet, at times even down over his breasts, so the poor fellow looked to be lactating. Seated on a crate, his big knees practically to his ears, he&#x2019;d eat a sandwich that had spilling from it mayonnaisey clumps of egg salad or tuna fish, landing on his shirt. More than once Henry saw Denise hand him a paper towel. &#x201c;That happens to me,&#x201d; Henry heard her say one day. &#x201c;Whenever I eat a sandwich that isn&#x2019;t just cold cuts, I end up a mess.&#x201d; It couldn&#x2019;t have been true. The girl was neat as a pin, if plain as a plate. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say when the telephone rang. &#x201c;This is the Village Pharmacy. How can I help you today?&#x201d; Like a girl playing grown-up. And then: On a Monday morning when the air in the pharmacy held a sharp chill, he went about opening up the store, saying, &#x201c;How was your weekend, Denise?&#x201d; Olive had refused to go to church the day before, and Henry, uncharacteristically, had spoken to her sharply. &#x201c;Is it too much to ask,&#x201d; he had found himself saying, as he stood in the kitchen in his undershorts, ironing his trousers. &#x201c;A man&#x2019;s wife accompanying him to church?&#x201d; Going without her seemed a public exposure of familial failure. &#x201c;Yes, it most certainly is too goddamn much to ask!&#x201d; Olive had almost spit, her fury&#x2019;s door flung open. &#x201c;You have no idea how tired I am, teaching all day, going to foolish meetings where the goddamn principal is a moron! Shopping. Cooking. Ironing. Laundry. Doing Christopher&#x2019;s homework with him! And you&#x2014;&#x201d; She had grabbed on to the back of a dining room chair, and her dark hair, still uncombed from its night&#x2019;s disarrangement, had fallen across her eyes. &#x201c;You, Mr. Head Deacon Claptrap Nice Guy, expect me to give up my Sunday mornings and go sit among a bunch of snot-wots!&#x201d; Very suddenly she had sat down in the chair. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sick and tired of it,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, calmly. &#x201c;Sick to death.&#x201d; A darkness had rumbled through him; his soul was suffocating in tar. The next morning, Olive spoke to him conversationally. &#x201c;Jim&#x2019;s&nbsp; car smelled like upchuck last week. Hope he&#x2019;s cleaned it out.&#x201d; Jim&nbsp; O&#x2019;Casey taught with Olive, and for years took both Christopher and Olive to school. &#x201c;Hope so,&#x201d; said Henry, and in that way their fight was done. &#x201c;Oh, I had a wonderful weekend,&#x201d; said Denise, her small eyes behind her glasses looking at him with an eagerness that was so childlike it could have cracked his heart in two. &#x201c;We went to Henry&#x2019;s folks and dug potatoes at night. Henry put the headlights on from the car and we dug potatoes. Finding the potatoes in that cold soil&#x2014;like an Easter egg hunt!&#x201d; He stopped unpacking a shipment of penicillin, and stepped down to talk to her. There were no customers yet, and below the front window the radiator hissed. He said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that lovely, Denise.&#x201d; She nodded, touching the top of the vitamin shelf beside her. A small motion of fear seemed to pass over her face. &#x201c;I got cold and went and sat in the car and watched Henry digging potatoes, and I thought: It&#x2019;s too good to be true.&#x201d;</p><h2>Let&#39;s Go to the Zoo: Fisher-Price Little People</h2><p>KEY SELLING POINTS:<br><br>* Success of format-our most successful Fisher Price Little People LIFT THE FLAPS <br> with over 2.1 million sold combined (See back of TI sheet for breakdown)<br>* Based on the popular Little People A to Z Learning Zoo play set.

It examines both the aesthetics and the social history of quilts from the early nineteenth century to the present, including Amish, African American, and modern art quilts.<br><br>From the state fair to the clothesline, women have sought ways to exhibit the beauty and optical effects of their quilts. The "quilting frolic" of the nineteenth century was for many women an alternative to the art academy and the salon. Janet Berlo reminds us that quilts were a valued form of artistic expression, meant to be shared and admired among the company of other women.<br><br>Over fifty applique and pieced quilts are illustrated, chosen from the collections of the International Quilt Study Center for their outstanding visual qualities. Each is accompanied by a lively dialogue among quilt experts that illustrates the varied dimensions of quilts as aesthetic objects of the highest order and as reflections of the lives and societies of their makers. This multifaceted analysis of quilts sheds light on the histories of women, textiles, and American art and culture.</p><p><p>A lavishly illustrated volume celebrating innovative design in American quilting</p><b>Janet Catherine Berlo </b>is professor of art history at the University of Rochester in New York.

Add a touch of romance to any room with this lovely quilt. The elegant pattern uses two strips intertwined to makea knot. The graceful, flow of the quilt is made with two basic, strip pieced blocks. By using color and value in your fabrics, the Lovers Knots stand out to show unity. The blocks are set a point a for a dramatic effect and corners can either be squared or diagonal. Eleanor offers step by step illustrations and instructions to direct the quilter to a successful finish. There are yardage and cutting charts for all 5 quilt sizes and border options for a personalized quilt. Included with the Lovers Knot quilt pattern, Eleanor gives directions for making a matching dust ruffle with tips on measuring and sewing the ruffle. A miniature wallhanging and long and short table runners are bonus projects in the book. They are pieced with narrow 1 1/2&#34; strips for a charming petite finish.</p><p>Twenty-nine years ago Eleanor Burns introduced her first Quilt in a Day book, cultivating a quiltmaking revolution. She presented her unique style, a diverse combination of cutting and sewing applications, creating new techniques altogether. Her concise step by step directions are easy to grasp, allowing the possibility for anyone to be successful at making a quilt. Eleanor Burns gave quiltmakers techniques that compacted months into merely a day, a quilt in a day, spreading her vibrant enthusiasm within everyone. She has motivated thousands of want-to-be quilters with needed confidence and assurance. Altogether, the impact of her influences opened the door to a renewal. Her efforts sowed the seeds that have grown into many techniques that are commonly used today. Since 1978 when she self-published her first book Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern, she has authored over seventy-five additional books. Throughout the world today, there are thousands of instructors teaching her quiltmaking methods. Her first Quilt in a Day TV series began airing on PBS in 1990 and is still broadcast nationwide and abroad and now her shows can be seen on the world wide Web.</p><h2>Bring It On Home: Peter Grant, Led Zeppelin, and Beyond -- The Story of Rock&#39;s Greatest Manager</h2><p><b>The authorized biography of the most notorious rock manager of all time, Peter Grant, best known for his work with Led Zeppelin</b><br><br>Peter Grant is the most famous music manager of all time. Often acknowledged as the "fifth member of Led Zeppelin," Grant's story has appeared in fragments across countless Zeppelin biographies, but none has explored who this brilliant and intuitive manager yet flawed and sometimes dangerous man truly was. No one has successfully captured the scope of his personality or his long-lasting impact on the music business.

They were the first foreigners to live in the region. <i>A Small Place in Italy</i> describes how the house was restored with the help of their neighbors, a colorful east of characters who quickly befriended the Newbys.<br><br>With his characteristic wry humor and sharp eye for the quirks of human nature, Eric Newby paints an unforgettable picture of rural Italy and its people. The rhythms and rituals of country life - harvesting grapes, making wine, hunting for wild mushrooms - are lovingly evoked, along with the storybook landscapes and changing seasons. At the center of his memoir is the farmhouse itself, which from unpromising beginnings - tileless roof, long-abandoned septic tank and mice the size of small cats - was gradually restored.<br></p><p>Eric Newby was born in London in 1919. In 1938, he joined the four-masted Finnish barque Moshulu as an apprentice and sailed in the last Grain Race from Australia to Europe, by way of Cape Horn. During World War II, he served in the Black Watch and the Special Boat Section. In 1942, he was captured and remained a prisoner-of-war until 1945. He subsequently married the girl who helped him to escape, and for the next fifty years, his wife Wanda was at his side on many adventures. After the war, he worked in the fashion business and book publishing but always travelled on a grand scale, sometimes as the Travel Editor for the Observer. He was made CBE in 1994 and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award of the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2001. Eric Newby died in 2006.As usual, Andrew Sachs gives a stellar performance in narrating this account of renovating a dilapidated farmhouse on the border of Tuscany. He rolls out nonstop Italian phrases and descriptions of local festivals as if he&#39;d been raised under an olive tree. But, alas, even the liveliest narration cannot transform 25 years in &#34;I Castagni&#34; with Eric Newby into one year in Provence with Peter Mayle. Although Newby is a highly respected travel writer, he lacks Mayle&#39;s flair for capturing colorful characters and lively dialogue. With such uninspired writing, few listeners may be tempted--even in imagination--to follow the rough road to &#34;a small place in Italy.&#34; J.C.

He worked for seven years in product development for Procter &amp; Gamble before joining Reasons To Believe, where he serves as vice president for science apologetics. He and his wife, Amy, have four daughters and a son. They live in southern California. <p>HUGH ROSS serves as president of Reasons to Believe and has written many books, including The Creator and the Cosmos, The Genesis Question, and Lights in the Sky and Little Green Men (coauthored with Kenneth Samples and Mark Clark). He has been a guest on numerous media programs such as Coast to Coast, The Barry Farber Show, Sirius Satellite Radio, 700 Club, and The Keith Rush Show. He lives in southern California with his wife, Kathy, and two sons.</p>Convinced that "creation is a testable idea that can fall within the domain of science," biochemist Rana and astrophysicist Ross do not shrink from scientific findings about the long and tumultuous history of the earth. Conceding that "the beginning of life (relative to cosmic history) under hellacious conditions poses initial problems for creationists and evolutionists alike," the authors argue that the origin and survival of life on earth over the past 3.8 billion years�&#x20ac;"now seen by most researchers as an awesomely improbable set of events�&#x20ac;"parallels biblical models of God "hover[ing] over early earth like a mother eagle brooding over her young." Although Rana and Ross are Christian apologists with the "Reasons to Believe" organization, their forays into theology are generally modest and brief. Their primary focus is compiling results from biology, chemistry and geology that illustrate how deeply puzzling the origin of life has become. Discussions of the "primordial soup" of prebiotic chemistry, the enigmatic origin of cell membranes and homochirality (the unexplained preponderance of left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars essential to life) all take readers further than is typical in the creation/evolution literature. Whether or not Rana and Ross quite prove a creation model�&#x20ac;"proof being in the eye of the beholder�&#x20ac;"they certainly tell a compelling story of the early history of life that inspires curiosity and a sense of wonder at what is still, for all we know, a unique habitable and inhabited world. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

De Kooning wrote for Art News in the 1950's, and amid today's jargon, theory, and various deconstructions, her essays--swift, taut, personal and to the point--are a delight to read as she, say, watches Arshile Gorky painstakingly build up a layered surface or David Smith puzzle out a devilishly complex bit of metalwork. De Kooning knew the great figures of the New York school--her husband Willem, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline--at firsthand from the early 40's, when they were not yet celebrities, and to her they're friends and acquaintances in low-rent studios, simply doing the work they do. With skepticism but also with love, she sifts through their self-created legends with a refreshing honesty after the hyperbole of gossip bios and the posthumous lawsuits, etc., that have surrounded the ``giants'' of the period. De Kooning's irreverent contemporary portraits restore the human scale, leaving out the machismo and the booze. The writer isn't doctrinaire, either, about the purity or primacy of abstract painting, but is perfectly willing, for example, to deflate the extremist pretensions of an Ad Reinhart in ``Pure Paints a Picture'' (1957). In the clairvoyant ``Subject, What, How or Who'' (1955), she explains how abstract and representational turn into one another; in ``Parody is King,'' she heralds a development on the art scene that was to choke out much else later on. She champions forgotten painter Edwin Dickinson; even Andrew Wyeth gets his due. Essays that are alive in new ways as they help us look back. Perhaps only an artist could write about other artists with such genuine curiosity and open-mindedness. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Lee Hall's revelatory <i>Elaine and Bill: Portrait of a Marriage: The Lives of Willem and Elaine de Kooning</i> drew Elaine de Kooning out from the shadow of her more famous spouse and reintroduced her as one of those rare creatures, a talented painter who wrote beautifully about painting. Now this selection of her critical essays not only displays de Kooning's literary finesse and critical acumen but also provides researchers with some key articulations of the aesthetics of abstract expressionism. These 28 pieces--introduced by de Kooning's sister, Marjorie Luyckx, who is editing de Kooning's memoirs and journals, and art critic Rose Slivka--span the dynamic years of 1949 through 1985 and discuss the work of such masters as Arshile Gorky, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Stuart Davis, Jackson Pollock, and, naturally, Willem de Kooning. In each of her essays, de Kooning moves fleetly from vivid visual descriptions to insightful interpretations of the artist's personality, methodology, and themes. Somehow, she manages to maintain an engaging, objective, and reportorial voice while, at the same time, revealing her profound involvement with her subject. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Exploring Creation with Chemistry &amp; Physics , Junior Notebooking Journal</h2><p>This paperback spiral notebook &#34; &#34;Exploring Creation with Chemistry and Physics&#34; is pre-owned and is in like new condition.

In this vividly-imagined debut, Katharine Beutner gives voice to the woman behind the ideal and reveals the part of the story that&#x2019;s never been told: What happened to Alcestis in the three days she spent in the underworld?</p><p><p>Katharine Beutner grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She earned a BA in classical studies from Smith College in 2003 and an MA in creative writing from the University of Texas at Austin, where she is currently a PhD student in eighteenth-century British literature.</p><p>Prologue<br><br>They knew the child&#x2019;s name only because her mother died cursing it, clutching at the bloodied bedclothes and spitting out the word as if it tasted sour on her tongue. After a few minutes her tongue stilled, and her limbs too, until she lay on the bed gray and cold as stone. The servants stood around the bed in a rough circle, looking down at the tangled mess the queen had made and thinking of the rituals her death would require, the sacrifices, the burning herbs nailed in clusters to the mud-brick walls. The room smelled of copper and sweat, as if a great battle had been fought within it. Anaxibia had warred with death and lost; for the moment, at least, her baby daughter had won.<br><br>They&#x2019;d wiped the babe off, tied the cord, and swaddled her in a blanket. She squalled at fi rst, face purple with incoherent rage, but then she lay quietly in her cradle as her mother&#x2019;s body hardened and cooled. She knew nothing of death. She came into the world as any girl might, unexpected, tolerated. If she hadn&#x2019;t been a royal child, she might have been left alone on a hillside to die nameless beneath the summer sun. As it was, Pelias had no time for the naming of girl children. The king would abandon the palace after hearing of his wife&#x2019;s death, taking a group of his best fi ghting men to hunt boar for the funeral feast, and would not return until the morning of her burial day. For two days the palace would be empty except for the children and the servants and the slaves and the animals and the body of the dead queen, swelling in the heat. The queen&#x2019;s spirit had already departed, trailing after the god Hermes like a cloak in the dust. The god had looked down at the baby in her cradle, a long, silent look, but she had not seen him&#x2014;or if she had, she had not cried at the sight.<br><br>But now the baby wriggled, bleated like a lamb. The queen&#x2019;s body servant sighed and wiped her bloody hands on her shift. Stirred out of reverie, the other women shook their heads and blinked in the low light.<br><br>The women leaned down and rolled Anaxibia&#x2019;s body over so they could strip the linens from the bed. The queen lay slumped on her side, her brown braids mussed and tangled, her face smooth. She was twenty-four years old. The baby girl in the cradle was her fi fth child, and the other children had been waiting for hours, clustered outside the bedchamber, to see their mother and new sibling. Their thin voices slipped into the room beneath the closed door. The women looked at each other. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; said the head maid, nodding to two of the others. &#x201c;They must be told. And the king too.&#x201d;<br><br>The chosen messengers left. After a moment, the children began to wail outside the door, their cries fading as the maids hurried them out of the women&#x2019;s quarters. The head maid turned back to the dead queen, then looked at the serious faces of the two other serving women who&#x2019;d stayed behind, looked over at the baby in the cradle. She bent down to pick up the child and balanced the baby&#x2019;s small damp head against her shoulder. &#x201c;Alcestis,&#x201d; she said and looked to the others for confirmation. &#x201c;That what you heard too?&#x201d;<br><br>Dry eyed and solemn, they nodded. They&#x2019;d seen this bloody struggle too often to weep. &#x201c;Alcestis,&#x201d; said Anaxibia&#x2019;s body servant, and looked at the baby, who had fallen asleep in the head maid&#x2019;s arms. &#x201c;Poor thing.&#x201d;<br><br>The head maid put the baby down on her back in the crib. She sent a servant to fetch the kitchen maid who&#x2019;d just borne a son, sent another to call the men to bring oils and cloths. The wet nurse took some time to arrive, but Alcestis did not cry. She lay in the cradle and listened to the skim and slap of the women&#x2019;s hands spreading oil on her mother&#x2019;s fl esh, the silky whispers as they combed out and rebraided her mother&#x2019;s hair. She breathed in the smell of the room, the bodily stench of failed combat with the gods, the reek of a thread snipped. The women watched the baby with nervous eyes as they worked. The two who lived to hear of Alcestis&#x2019; death&#x2014;if one could call it death&#x2014;would recall her birth then, and mutter to each other about the way the girl had opened her tiny mouth to suck in the fouled air as if it could replace her mother&#x2019;s milk. Perhaps she&#x2019;d grown used to death then, they&#x2019;d say. Perhaps she&#x2019;d been hungry for it all her life.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remember those moments, those sounds, those smells. But this is what I imagine from what I was told as I grew older. This, said the maids, the servants, my sisters&#x2014;this was how your story began.<br><br>When I was eight years old, I lived with my sisters in the stuffy upper quarters of the palace at Iolcus. We had a small room to ourselves, a chamber that adjoined the<br>female servants&#x2019; quarters, big enough to hold the bed, a bench, and a small table. It was the room we&#x2019;d all been born in, the room our mother had died in, though only Pisidice was old enough to remember the disaster of my birth. The room no longer held any traces of our mother. It was a girls&#x2019; room now, temporary and&nbsp; unembellished, a place for princesses to sleep and grow until we were old enough to be married and carried away.<br><br>I slept with Hippothoe and Pisidice, jammed in the middle because I was the smallest. Pisidice came to bed smelling of crushed fl owers and wet linen and kicked in her sleep. Hippothoe smelled of garlic and sweat, but it was a warm smell, not unpleasant,<br>and on this night I&#x2019;d fallen asleep curled up against her bony shoulder with my nose pushed into her skin. The bedchamber was dark and quiet when her writhing woke me. I felt the hot point of her elbow in my chest, quickly withdrawn, and then a light hesitant touch on my arm. I sat up half alert in the darkness&nbsp;and scrubbed at my face with my palms. Hippothoe looked up at me, eyes panic-bright, hands fluttering between us in time with her wheezing breath. She shook her head once and I understood.<br><br>She was always sorry for waking me, always spent her regained breath on apologies I didn&#x2019;t need. She had these panting fits often, sometimes only nights apart, and I knew we would both be limp and lazy in the morning&#x2014;but it was my duty to get help, like Hippothoe&#x2019;s own little goddess of health, and I&#x2019;d grown so used to the role that I almost enjoyed it. I squeezed her hot hand, climbed down from the bed, and stumbled off to wake the servants in the outer room.<br><br>The head maid sighed when I touched her, a low, miserable sound, as if she could not bear being dragged from sleep. But she hauled herself out of bed and followed me into the bedchamber to fetch Hippothoe. My sister sat on the edge of the bed, shoulders hunched and heaving, the ends of her hair brushing her hands as they twisted in her lap. She leaned on me to stand, her body shaking as we walked, and I felt strong as a tower beneath her arm.<br><br>The head maid led us bleary eyed to the hearth, stepping over slaves sleeping in the halls. We stumbled down the stairs and past our father&#x2019;s empty throne. In the kitchens the head maid boiled water so Hippothoe could breathe the steam and<br>rubbed cut garlic under her nose as she gasped and coughed.<br><br>The air grew thick and my shift clung to my body, clammy with steam and fear. The head maid and I prayed to Apollo, running through the chant we said so often that I worried the god would tire of our entreaties. I believed then that he listened to me when I prayed. I imagined him stealing silently among us, reaching out to touch Hippothoe&#x2019;s chest with one golden-glowing hand, calming her, fixing her. I held my breath when Hippothoe choked and let it out only when her wheezing smoothed and slowed.<br><br>In the bedchamber, Pisidice still slept heavily, only muttering a little when Hippothoe and I collapsed onto the bed and tucked our damp bodies together. I put my cheek against my sister&#x2019;s shuddery chest and my arm along her neck. We looked like one gray-limbed creature, one divine monster, one flesh. I thought we would never be separated.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Hippothoe whispered to me as faintly as if she spoke across a great distance, while I stroked her forehead. &#x201c;Alcestis, sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>*<br><br>In the morning Hippothoe&#x2019;s breath smelled faintly sweet, like a baby&#x2019;s, from the honey the head maid had given her for her roughened throat. I lay beside her, my back to Pisidice and my cheek hot on the linens. I had to pee. I&#x2019;d been thinking of getting<br>up to use the privy by the kitchens before the heat made the smell too terrible. I liked to walk through the quiet palace, to watch the servants and slaves twitch in their dreams like puppies, to watch my sisters snort and toss in the bed. But I waited, for I wanted Hippothoe to wake enough to pet my hair. On some mornings she&#x2019;d drift into sleep again with a hand curved around my skull while I listened to her heart thud beneath her ribs.<br><br>Now she stirred, restless and exhausted, and I felt Pisidice bolt into alertness with an allover twitch of her limbs. My eldest sister yawned, rolling, and kneed me in the back. Then she slipped out of bed and went to sit by the narrow window, settling in to watch the shepherds in the distant fi elds and gaze hungrily at the road as if she expected a visitor. Pisidice did this every morning.<br><br>She was twelve years old and desperate for marriage.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s coming, you know,&#x201d; Hippothoe said, and coughed hard, jarring me. She rested her thin hand on top of my unruly head.<br><br>&#x201c;No suitors today, Lady Pisidice,&#x201d; I echoed, emboldened by Hippothoe&#x2019;s words. Pisidice did not look away from the window; I wasn&#x2019;t worth her attention. She&#x2019;d left her comb and jar of oil on the sill and now she rubbed the oil between her palms and smoothed it over her hair, combing it through while she looked out over the royal road. The oil made her braid heavy and sticky; it made her smell like every other woman in the<br>palace. I did not like it.<br><br>I began to tell her so, but Hippothoe hushed me and eased me up to sit, levering herself out of bed. &#x201c;Let her be, Alcestis,&#x201d; she said, only half mocking. &#x201c;She has to prepare herself.&#x201d;<br><br>Hippothoe didn&#x2019;t bother with her hair. It stood out around her head like a cloud, wavy fi ne and softer than wool. On some mornings she let me braid it and I wove the light brown strands about my fingers like rope. My own hair grew in bristling waves just past my chin. I&#x2019;d had a bad fever the year before, bad enough that I had prayed to Apollo for my own health, and the head maid had chopped it off. Now I tugged a comb through it a few times before giving up. Pisidice turned her sharp eyes toward me.<br>&#x201c;Really, put on a headband,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You look like a boy. No man&#x2019;ll ever want to marry you.&#x201d;<br><br>Hippothoe, standing over the basin of water by the door, barked a laugh. &#x201c;Perhaps she&#x2019;ll have better luck finding a husband if she does look like a boy.&#x201d; Pisidice pitched the comb at her. Neither of them would tell me what they&#x2019;d meant, though Hippothoe began snickering again as she yanked her shift over her head.<br><br>Our mother&#x2019;s body servant helped us dress. Pisidice was old enough to wear a maid&#x2019;s bodice, though she hardly filled it out. She was lucky she still had time to grow some breasts before she&#x2019;d have to wear a matron&#x2019;s open bodice. I plucked at the lacings until she whirled around and smacked my fingers.<br><br>The body servant waited, hands hovering in the air, until we&#x2019;d settled down, then fi xed each lace so they lay in a neat ladder across Pisidice&#x2019;s narrow back. Pisidice turned, cupping the servant&#x2019;s hands in her own, and nodded at her as graciously as a<br>queen. Practicing. I rolled my eyes and chewed on the skin next to my thumbnail while Hippothoe tied back my mess of hair. I had to look presentable for the ritual.<br><br>It was the tenth day of the new year, the day of the dead vessel, and Hippothoe and I could not work or eat until we&#x2019;d done the ritual in honor of our grandparents, Poseidon and the lady Tyro. My stomach already felt hollow. I hung near Hippothoe as we went downstairs, shoving my hand into the crook of her elbow. The skin below her eyes looked purplish gray, stained with weariness, but still she smiled and let me press close.<br><br>Pisidice was too busy to help. At twelve she ran the kitchens and supervised the slaves and decided our chores for the day, whether we ought to weave or spin, direct the washing or work in the kitchens. When we married, we would be mistresses of our own palaces, and Pisidice wanted nothing more. I watched her confer with the head maid, Pisidice&#x2019;s dark head tilted up toward the older woman&#x2019;s, her face serious. The slaves had prepared a place for the dead vessel; the omens of the skies had been propitious. It was the right hour for honoring the god of the sea, our grandfather, our household lord&#x2014;and our absent grandmother. Tyro still lived, but elsewhere; Pelias was not a man who thrived on the care of his mother, and when his father,&nbsp;Cretheus, had died he&#x2019;d installed her in a smaller villa in the mountains, given her thirty slaves, and sent my young brothers to see her on days when she would need help to perform the family rituals. I had seen her only once, several years before, and even then she&#x2019;d been a stooped, gray woman, few signs left of the beauty that had drawn Poseidon to her. She had shouted at Pelias; I remembered that because I had enjoyed it so much. But despite their rancor we celebrated her often in ritual, reminding Poseidon of his love for her and his duty to Iolcus.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ready,&#x201d; Pisidice said to us, distracted. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br>I peered through the kitchen doors to the hall. I had not heard Pelias that morning; he never spoke more quietly than a bellow, and my sisters and I tracked him by sound. If we could, we kept away from him in the mornings, when he shouted at<br>the servants who woke him. We&#x2019;d retreat to our quarters before he returned to the palace for his midday meal, sit on the bed together, and pick at our haul of cakes and cheese until a slave came to fetch us again. But today was a ritual day, and it would<br>not be easy for us to avoid our father.<br><br>Hippothoe waited, silent. Finally Pisidice sighed. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the stables,&#x201d; she said, and Hippothoe glanced at me and nodded. She took my hand and led me through the hallways to the great hall. A few villagers stood by the doors, awaiting our father; in the afternoons, Pelias sat court here and settled the quarrels of his subjects. He did not yell much. Men would leave with chastened looks, like misbehaving boys called to task, and walk down the broad porch steps speaking of Pelias&#x2019;s fairness, his calm, kingly demeanor. I wanted to roll my eyes whenever I heard them talk of his virtues, but I was convinced that Pelias would appear to catch me before my eyes had made one revolution in my head. Even though I hadn&#x2019;t heard<br>Pelias&#x2019;s voice, even though Pisidice had said he was elsewhere, I looked for him nervously as we entered the great hall. I saw Hippothoe look too.<br><br>The two-handled vessel sat by the round hearth, where Hippothoe had placed it on the fi rst day of the new year after the slaves brought it up from the shore; we girls were forbidden to walk into the water, even for ritual purposes. The seaweed circling the vessel&#x2019;s base had stained the clay white. Hippothoe knelt before the jar, picking the seaweed away and passing it to me as she whispered thanks to the local gods of the shore for giving ...</p></p><h2>The Thing</h2><p>A strange unknown creature attacks the inhabitants of a secluded outpost in the Antarctic</p><p></p><h2>The Parker Lyon Harrah&#39;s Pony Express Museum: A Photographic Essay</h2><p>Hundreds of photos of the William Parker collection and museum which was dispersed in 1986.

This is wrong, says Richard Florida: we&#39;ve chosen to alter our values, work, and lifestyle, and for good economic reasons. Why have we done this?Florida finds the answer in the rise of a new social class. Like other classes, its basis is economic. Just as the feudal aristocracy derived its identity and values from its hereditary control of land and people, and the bourgeoisie derived its identity and values from its role as merchants of goods, the Creative Class derives its identity and values from its role as purveyors of creativity. When we see ourselves as &#34;creative,&#34; our self-image affects the choices we make in every area of our lives.Based on a massive body of research, The Rise of the Creative Class chronicles the ongoing sea-change in people&#39;s choices and attitudes, and shows not only what&#39;s happening but also how it stems from a fundamental economic change. The Creative Class now comprises nearly forty million Americans, or more than 25% of all employed people. The choices these people make have already had a huge economic impact, and in the future they will determine how the workplace is organized, what companies will prosper or go bankrupt, and even which cities will thrive or wither.</p><p>Richard Florida is H. John Heinz III Professor of Regional Economic Development, Heinz School of Public Policy and Management, Carnegie Mellon University. A columnist for Information Week (circ. 400,000), he gives fifty to one hundred invited lectures a year, to mostly business audiences. He lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Florida, an academic whose field is regional economic development, explains the rise of a new social class that he labels the creative class. Members include scientists, engineers, architects, educators, writers, artists, and entertainers. He defines this class as those whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology, and new creative content. In general this group shares common characteristics, such as creativity, individuality, diversity, and merit. The author estimates that this group has 38 million members, constitutes more than 30 percent of the U.S. workforce, and profoundly influences work and lifestyle issues. The purpose of this book is to examine how and why we value creativity more highly than ever and cultivate it more intensely. He concludes that it is time for the creative class to grow up--boomers and Xers, liberals and conservatives, urbanites and suburbanites--and evolve from an amorphous group of self-directed while high-achieving individuals into a responsible, more cohesive group interested in the common good. <i>Mary Whaley</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In order to heal from traumas, we unknowingly repeat the stories of our lives again and again, reliving them in different scenarios in this life as well as in other lifetimes. This repetition of our behavior patterns is neither neurotic nor pathological. It is absolutely necessary, because painful though it may be, repetition offers us multiple opportunities for facing our issues, making new choices, and healing ourselves at last. </p> <p>All of us have a God-given gift of free choice, although we may be unaware of it at times. Only when we acknowledge and take full responsibility for the choices we&#x2019;ve made in our current and past lives can we begin to change our stories and end the suffering we&#x2019;ve been causing ourselves.</p> <p>This material is based on Doris&#x2019;s 30 years of clinical experience with patients, using traditional therapy techniques combined with past-life regression therapy. It is guided and inspired by her communication with Guides and Angels of the Light, who have accompanied her for many years.</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these pages, Doris presents the 7 Steps of Rebirth, which provide a profound yet swift and simple route to change our lives and heal ourselves. Her 4 Steps of Joy offer a powerful tool for accessing the Light swiftly and easily. Remembering the events of our past lives provides a rich and fascinating tapestry of our journey, resulting in the humbling and uplifting realization that our souls are on a grand adventure. In owning our stories, we move from seeing ourselves as victims of life to empowering ourselves as co-creators of our destiny.</p><p><p><b>Doris Eliana Cohen, Ph.D., </b>has been a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist in private practice for more than 30 years, treating thousands of clients.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>An acclaimed bestseller and international sensation, Patrick Suskind's classic novel provokes a terrifying examination of what happens when one man's indulgence in his greatest passion-his sense of smell-leads to murder. <br>In the slums of eighteenth-century France, the infant Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born with one sublime gift-an absolute sense of smell. As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris, and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs. But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and frest-cut wood. Then one day he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the "ultimate perfume"-the scent of a beautiful young virgin.

The technique, pioneered by artist Chris K. Palmer, creates patterns from a single, uncut panel of cloth, using a simple, three-step process.<br>In <i>Shadowfolds</i>, Jeff Rutzky, himself an accomplished and passionate origamist, and Palmer offer detailed and fascinating information about the technique and its origins in both Moorish tile and classic Japanese origami. Palmer first encountered the elaborate mosaics of the Alhambra and became intrigued with learning to translate these patterns into folded paper. He turned for inspiration to the work of Japanese origami masters Tomoko Fuse, Jun Maekawa, Toshikazu Kawasaki and Shuzo Fujimoto, as well as to the great American origami artists Robert Lang and Peter Engel.<br>The transition to working in cloth followed. The flexible property of cloth allows pleats to be folded to augment and give a dimensionality not present in a flat surface; and the translucent quality adds a unique intricacy to the geometric patterns. When lines in a pattern are folded as pleats, the resulting shapes formed by the pleats become part of the artistic expression of the material.<br>The possibilities for using <i>Shadowfolds</i> in design are limitless. Some applications take advantage of light shining through the fabric, others show the richness of the folds that have a depth all their own. In addition to explaining the three very simple steps of the technique, the authors show how even novice folders can create breathtaking works of textile art, as well as fashion-forward clothes, accessories and home furnishings incorporating these three-dimensional embellishments.

The twisted legacy of her family has never quite let go of Mariel, but now in this memoir she opens up about her claustrophobic marriage, her acting career, and turning to spiritual healers and charlatans for solace.<br> <br>Ultimately Mariel has written a story of triumph about learning to overcome her family&#x2019;s demons and developing love and deep compassion for them.

Coffeehouses have provided places to plan revolutions, write poetry, do business, and meet friends. The coffee industry has dominated and molded the economy, politics, and social structure of entire countries.Mark Pendergrast introduces the reader to an eccentric cast of characters, all of them with a passion for the golden bean. <i>Uncommon Grounds</i> is nothing less than a coffee-flavored history of the world.</p><p>Since its discovery in an Ethiopian rainforest centuries ago, coffee has brewed up a rich and troubled history, according to <i>Uncommon Grounds</i>, a sweeping book by business writer Mark Pendergrast. Over the years, the beverage has fomented revolution, spurred deforestation, enriched a few while impoverishing the many, and addicted millions with its psychoactive caffeine. Coffee is now the world's second most valuable legal commodity, behind oil, according to Pendergrast, who is also author of <i>For God, Country, and Coca-Cola</i>.<p> "A good cup of coffee can turn the worst day tolerable, can provide an all-important moment of contemplation, can rekindle a romance," he writes. "And yet, poetic as its taste may be, coffee's history is rife with controversy and politics." For example, coffee bankrolled Idi Amin's genocidal regime in Uganda and the Sandinistas' revolution in Nicaragua. <i>Uncommon Grounds</i> provides some fascinating tidbits. Did you know that coffeehouses helped spawn the French and American revolutions? Or that coffee supplanted alcohol as a favorite breakfast drink in Britain in the late 1600s, and later became a patriotic American beverage after the Boston Tea Party? Pendergrast also details the rise and fall of regional coffee brands in the United States, the role of advertising in the industry, the global economic impact of coffee prices, and the recent emergence of specialty-coffee retailers--Starbucks, for example. Finally, he explores the social and environmental ramifications of coffee and highlights recent attempts to encourage a livable wage and environmental protection in coffee-producing nations such as Brazil. Pendergrast also includes an appendix on "how to brew the perfect cup." This wide-ranging book is a good read for those curious about the history and context behind that morning cup of coffee, as well as for those strictly interested in the business side of the industry. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p><b>Mark Pendergrast</b> was born in Atlanta and is a graduate of Harvard University.

The object of this unprecedented speculation was the tulip, a delicate and exotic Eastern import that had bewitched horticulturists, noblemen, and tavern owners alike. A trade in tulips soon evolved, and for almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house.<br><br>Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history -- and like all the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair. But that was not the first instance of tulipomania -- nor would it be the last.<br><br>This is the history of the tulip, from its origins on the barren windswept steppes of central Asia, to its place of honor in the lush imperial gardens of Constantinople, to its starring moment as the most coveted -- and beautiful -- commodity in Europe. Historian Mike Dash vividly narrates the story of this amazing flower and the colorful cast of characters whose lives were inextricably entwined with it. There is the eccentric Turkish sultan Ahmed III, whose reign even to this day is known as the Tulip Era, and the French academic Carolus Clusius, the most respected botanist of his time, whose gifts of the then-unknown bulbs to friends and patrons sparked the Dutch tulipomania. There's even the lowly tavern owner Wouter Winkel, whose death in 1633 left his seven children destitute -- until they dug up his bed of tulip bulbs and sold them at auction during the height of the tulip mania, an auction that transformed his heirs from penniless orphans to wealthy young men and women who would never have to work a day in their lives. Centuries apart historically, and worlds apart culturally, this cast of characters all had one thing in common: tulipomania.</p><p>For history buffs or gardeners who enjoy more than just digging in the dirt, <i>Tulipomania</i> presents a fascinating look at the tulip frenzy that took place in Holland in the mid-1600s. Beginning as gifts given among the wealthy and educated folk of Europe and Asia, the tulip rapidly became a source of incredible financial gain--similar to today's Internet start-up companies or Beanie Baby collections. Stories of craftsmen discontinuing their trade and focusing on raising tulips for public auction, where they sold for prices comparable to that of a manor house, are astonishing. Poets, moralists, businessmen--it seems everyone was involved at some level. <p> Lack of regulation and poor quality control were just a couple of the details that led to the abrupt crash in February 1637. Tulipomania was the original market bust--people were ruined, debts went unpaid. It was a disaster similar to the stock-market crash of 1929. A brief resurrection of the mania occurred 65 years later in Istanbul, and while it was not the financial obsession Holland experienced, it led to the creation of standards in flower shape and increased the development of new types. You don't need to be obsessed to enjoy this book--an interest in tulips, history, and the futures market ensures that this will be a remarkable read. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>"A marvelous parable of greed, skullduggery, opulence, extravagance, and retribution." -- Simon Singh, author of <i>Fermat's Enigma</i><br><br>"A fascinating exploration of human greed and self-delusion -- and also a tribute to our ageless search for beauty.

The narrative is based on Matilda's extensive, recently available diaries in which she recorded a lifetime of observation that revealed her connoisseurship and social interactions. Here she recounted everyday life, from hiring and firing servants to social extravaganzas, lifelong friendship with Edith Wharton, intimate conversations with Henry James, the acquisition and activities at her beloved Chateau Breau, and France during World War I. Fully illustrated with Walter's signature paintings of well-furnished interiors that were popular with the aristocracy and wealthy of his day, the book will transport the reader back in time to a lavish, privileged, well-mannered, and leisured way of life that was shared by a rarefied few. Rieder has succeeded in rescuing a unique social and artistic history that is well researched and a joy to read. Recommended for most public, social history, art school, and museum collections.

In relating the stories of three couples, the novel raises questions that still torment women and men today: Is marriage a viable institution? Should one bear children in hard times? Does sexuality destroy the possibility of significant political action? And what is the political responsibility of intellectuals?</p><p>TESS SLESINGER (1905 - 1945) lived in New York until 1935, when she moved to Hollywood to work as a screenwriter.

PAUL LAUTER is professor of American literature at Trinity College."Unlike so many other thirties novels,&nbsp;<i>The Unpossessed</i>&nbsp;treats the &#x201c;topical&#x201d; themes of its age as subsets of a much larger, more abiding theme in literature: the folly of all human (and particularly of pompous intellectual) endeavor that aims at imposing a rational direction on something as incorrigibly messy as history.

Hypnotic, shocking, and chillingly erotic, this is a novel of mesmerizing beauty and astonishing force&#x2013;a story of danger and flight, of love and loss, of suspense and resolution, and of the extraordinary power of the senses. It is a novel only Anne Rice could write.</p><p>In the now-classic novel <i>Interview with the Vampire</i>, Anne Rice refreshed the archetypal vampire myth for a late-20th-century audience. The story is ostensibly a simple one: having suffered a tremendous personal loss, an 18th-century Louisiana plantation owner named Louis Pointe du Lac descends into an alcoholic stupor. At his emotional nadir, he is confronted by Lestat, a charismatic and powerful vampire who chooses Louis to be his fledgling. The two prey on innocents, give their "dark gift" to a young girl, and seek out others of their kind (notably the ancient vampire Armand) in Paris. But a summary of this story bypasses the central attractions of the novel. First and foremost, the method Rice chose to tell her tale--with Louis' first-person confession to a skeptical boy--transformed the vampire from a hideous predator into a highly sympathetic, seductive, and all-too-human figure. Second, by entering the experience of an immortal character, one raised with a deep Catholic faith, Rice was able to explore profound philosophical concerns--the nature of evil, the reality of death, and the limits of human perception--in ways not possible from the perspective of a more finite narrator.<p> While Rice has continued to investigate history, faith, and philosophy in subsequent Vampire novels (including <i>The Vampire Lestat</i>, <i>The Queen of the Damned</i>, <i>The Tale of the Body Thief</i>, <i>Memnoch the Devil</i>, and <i>The Vampire Armand</i>), <i>Interview</i> remains a treasured masterpiece. It is that rare work that blends a childlike fascination for the supernatural with a profound vision of the human condition. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>It seems amazing to me that I didn't get around to reading this book until years after it had been first published, especially because I'm a big vampire fan. I was working in a bookstore and finally picked it up...and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. Interview is one of those books that stays with you long after you've read it. I still have moments were something will remind me of it and I'll sit there thinking about a particular scene or character. It was only a few months after reading this, and tearing through the sequel, as well, that I went to work for Ballantine and got the chance to sell Anne Rice's books as well as read them.

Excellent resource books.</p><p>Historically, the book of Exodus treats of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt; but viewed doctrinally, it deals with redemption. Just as the first book of the Bible teaches that God elects unto salvation, so the second instructs us how God saves, namely, by redemption.Pink (1890-1953) was a Baptist Preacher in England, Australia, and the United States. He is most famous for his book The Sovereignty of God. After its advent, he, assisted by his editor Mr. I. Herendeen, launched his yearly publication, Studies in the Scriptures in 1921. These continued until his death, totaling altogether 33 volumes of 288 pp. each.

There too were Cliff Asness, the sharp-tongued, mercurial founder of the hedge fund AQR, a man as famous for his computer-smashing rages as for his brilliance, and Boaz Weinstein, chess life-master and king of the credit default swap, who while juggling $30 billion worth of positions for Deutsche Bank found time for frequent visits to Las Vegas with the famed MIT card-counting team. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On that night in 2006, these four men and their cohorts were the new kings of Wall Street. &nbsp;Muller, Griffin, Asness, and Weinstein were among the best and brightest of a &nbsp;new breed, the <i>quants</i>. &nbsp;Over the prior twenty years, this species of math whiz --technocrats who make billions not with gut calls or fundamental analysis but with formulas and high-speed computers-- had usurped the testosterone-fueled, kill-or-be-killed risk-takers who&#x2019;d long been the alpha males the world&#x2019;s largest casino. &nbsp;The quants believed that a dizzying, indecipherable-to-mere-mortals cocktail of differential calculus, quantum physics, and advanced geometry held the key to reaping riches from the financial markets. &nbsp;And they helped create a digitized money-trading machine that could shift billions around the globe with the click of a mouse. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Few realized that night, though, that in creating this unprecedented machine, men like Muller, Griffin, Asness and Weinstein had sowed the seeds for history&#x2019;s greatest financial disaster. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on unprecedented access to these four number-crunching titans, <i>The Quants </i>tells the inside story of what they thought and felt in the days and weeks when they helplessly watched much of their net worth vaporize &#x2013; and wondered just how their mind-bending formulas and genius-level IQ&#x2019;s had led them so wrong, so fast. &nbsp;Had their years of success been dumb luck, fool&#x2019;s gold, a good run that could come to an end on any given day? &nbsp;What if The Truth they sought -- the secret of the markets -- wasn&#x2019;t knowable? Worse, what if there wasn&#x2019;t any Truth? <br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Quants</i>, Scott Patterson tells the story not just of these men, but of Jim Simons, the reclusive founder of the most successful hedge fund in history; Aaron Brown, the quant who used his math skills to humiliate Wall Street&#x2019;s old guard at their trademark game of Liar&#x2019;s Poker, and years later found himself with a front-row seat to the rapid emergence of mortgage-backed securities; and gadflies and dissenters such as Paul Wilmott, Nassim Taleb, and Benoit Mandelbrot. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> With the immediacy of today&#x2019;s NASDAQ close and the timeless power of a Greek tragedy, <i>The Quants</i> is at once a masterpiece of explanatory journalism, a gripping tale of ambition and hubris...and an ominous warning about Wall Street&#x2019;s future. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SCOTT PATTERSON is a staff reporter at <i>The Wall Street Journal covering</i> the latest cutting-edge technological advances on Wall Street. This is his first book.1: All in One<br><br>Peter Muller stepped into the posh Versailles Room of the century old&nbsp;St. Regis Hotel in midtown Manhattan and took in the glittering scene in a glance.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the trio of cut-glass chandeliers hung from a gilt-laden ceiling that caught his attention, nor the pair of antique floor-to-ceiling mirrors to his left, nor the guests&#x2019; svelte Armani suits and gemstudded dresses. Something else in the air made him smile: the smell of money. And the sweet perfume of something he loved even more: pure, unbridled testosterone-fueled competition. It was intoxicating, and it was all around him, from the rich fizz of a fresh bottle of champagne popping open to the knowing nods and winks of his friends as he moved into a room that was a virtual murderer&#x2019;s row of topflight bankers and hedge fund managers, the richest in the world. His people.<br><br>It was March 8, 2006, and the Wall Street Poker Night Tournament was about to begin. More than a hundred well- heeled players milled about the room, elite traders and buttoned-down dealmakers by day, gambling enthusiasts by night. The small, private affair was a gathering of a select group of wealthy and brilliant individuals who had, through<br>sheer brainpower and a healthy dose of daring, become the new tycoons of Wall Street. This high-finance haut monde&#x2014;perhaps Muller most of all&#x2014;was so secretive that few people outside the room had ever heard their names. And yet, behind the scenes, their decisions controlled the ebb and flow of billions of dollars coursing through the<br>global financial system every day.<br><br>Mixed in with the crowd were professional poker players such as T. J. Cloutier, winner of sixty major tournaments, and Clonie Gowen, a blond Texan bombshell with the face of a fashion model and the body of a <i>Playboy</i> pinup. More important to the gathering crowd, Gowen was one of the most successful female poker players in the country.<br><br>Muller, tan, fit, and at forty-two looking a decade younger than his age, a wiry Pat Boone in his prime, radiated the relaxed cool of a man accustomed to victory. He waved across the room to Jim Simons, billionaire math genius and founder of the most successful hedge fund on the planet, Renaissance Technologies. Simons, a balding, whitebearded<br>wizard of quantitative investing, winked back as he continued chatting with the circle of admirers hovering around him.<br><br>The previous year, Simons had pocketed $1.5 billion in hedge fund fees, at the time the biggest one-year paycheck ever earned by a hedge fund manager. His elite team of traders, hidden away in a small enclave on Long Island, marshaled the most mind-bending advances in science and mathematics, from quantum physics to artificial intelligence to voice recognition technology, to wring billions in profits from the market. Simons was the rare investor who could make Muller feel jaw-clenchingly jealous. <br><br>The two had known each other since the early 1990s, when Muller briefly considered joining Renaissance before starting his own quantitative hedge fund inside Morgan Stanley, the giant New York investment bank. Muller&#x2019;s elite trading group, which he called Process Driven Trading, was so secretive that even most employees at Morgan weren&#x2019;t aware of its existence. Yet over the previous decade the group, composed of only about fifty people, had racked up a track record that could go toe-to-toe with the best investment outfits on Wall Street, cranking out $6 billion in gains for Morgan.<br><br>Muller and Simons were giants among an unusual breed of investors known as &#x201c;quants.&#x201d; They used brain-twisting math and superpowered computers to pluck billions in fleeting dollars out of the market. By the early 2000s, such tech-savvy investors had come to dominate Wall Street, helped by theoretical breakthroughs in the application<br>of mathematics to financial markets, advances that had earned their discoverers several shelves of Nobel Prizes. The quants applied those same breakthroughs to the highly practical, massively profitable practice of calculating predictable patterns in how the market moved and worked.<br><br>These computer-driven investors couldn&#x2019;t care less about a company&#x2019;s &#x201c;fundamentals,&#x201d; amorphous qualities such as the morale of its employees or the cut of its chief executive&#x2019;s jib. That was for the dinosaurs of Wall Street, the Warren Buffetts and Peter Lynches of the world, investors who focused on factors such as what a company actually<br>made and whether it made it well. Quants were agnostic on such matters, devoting themselves instead to predicting whether a company&#x2019;s stock would move up or down based on a dizzying array of numerical variables such as how cheap it was relative to the rest of the market, how quickly the stock had risen or declined, or a combination<br>of the two&#x2014;and much more.<br><br>That night at the St. Regis was a golden hour for the quants, a predators&#x2019; ball for the pocket-protector set. They were celebrating their dominance of Wall Street, just as junk bond kings such as Michael Milken had ruled the financial world in the 1980s or swashbuckling, trade-from-the-hip hedge fund managers such as George Soros had conquered the Street in the 1990s.<br><br>Muller flicked a lock of sandy brown hair from his eyes and snatched a glass of wine from a passing tray, looking for his friends. A few nonquants, fundamental investors of the old guard, rubbed elbows with the quant crowd that night. David Einhorn, the boy-faced manager of Greenlight Capital (so named when his wife gave him the green light to launch a fund in the 1990s), could be seen chatting on a cell phone by a tall, narrow window overlooking the corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue. Just thirty-seven years old, Einhorn was quickly gaining a reputation as one of the sharpest fundamental investors in the business, putting up returns of 20 percent or more year after year. Einhorn was also an ace poker player who would place eighteenth in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas the following year, winning $659,730.<br><br>The next billionaire Muller spotted was Ken Griffin, the blueeyed, notoriously ruthless manager of Chicago&#x2019;s Citadel Investment Group, one of the largest and most successful hedge funds in the business. Grave dancer of the hedge funds, Citadel was known for sweeping in on distressed companies and gobbling up the remains of the bloodied carcasses. But the core engines of his fund were computer driven mathematical models that guided its every move. Griffin, who sported a no-nonsense buzz cut of jet-black hair, was the sort of man who triggered a dark sense of foreboding even in close associates: <i>Wouldn&#x2019;t want to mess with Ken in a dark alley. Does he ever smile? The guy wants to be king of everything he touches.<br></i><br>&#x201c;Petey boy.&#x201d;<br><br>Muller felt a jolt in his back. It was his old friend and poker pal Cliff Asness, manager of AQR Capital Management, among the first pure quant hedge funds. Asness, like Muller, Griffin, and Simons, was a pioneer among the quants, having started out at Goldman Sachs in the early 1990s.<br><br>&#x201c;Decided to grace us tonight?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Asness knew Muller wouldn&#x2019;t miss this quant poker coronation for the world. Muller was obsessed with poker, had been for years. He&#x2019;d recently roped Asness into a private high-stakes poker game played with several other traders and hedge fund hotshots in ritzy Manhattan hotel rooms. The game had a $10,000 buy-in, couch cushion change to topflight traders such as Asness and Muller.<br><br>The quants ran the private poker game, but more traditional investment titans joined in. Carl Icahn, the billionaire financier who&#x2019;d gotten his start on Wall Street with $4,ooo in poker winnings, was a regular. So was Marc Lasry, manager of Avenue Capital Group, the $12 billion hedge fund that would hire former first daughter Chelsea Clinton<br>later that year. Lasry was known for being a cool investor whose icy demeanor belied his let-it-roll mentality. He was said to have once wagered $100,000 on a hand without even looking at his cards. And won.<br><br>The real point of Asness&#x2019;s needle was that he never knew when the globetrotting Muller would be in town. One week he&#x2019;d be trekking in Bhutan or white-water rafting in Bolivia, the next heli-skiing in the Grand Tetons or singing folk songs in a funky cabaret in Greenwich Village. Muller had even been spotted belting out Bob Dylan tunes in<br>New York&#x2019;s subway system, his keyboard case sprinkled with coins from charitable commuters with no idea the seemingly down-on-his luck songster was worth hundreds of millions and flew around in a private jet.<br><br>Asness, a stocky, balding man with a meaty face and impish blue eyes, wore khaki pants and a white tee peeking out from his open collar. He winked, stroking the orange-gray stubble of his trimmed beard. Though he lacked Muller&#x2019;s savoir faire, Asness was far wealthier, manager of his own hedge fund, and a rising power in the investment world. His firm, AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, was managing $25 billion and growing fast.<br><br>The year before, Asness had been the subject of a lengthy and glowing profile in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. He was a scourge of bad practices in the money management industry, such as ridiculously high fees at mutual funds. And he had the intellectual chops to back up his attacks. Known as one of the smartest investors in the world, Asness had worked hard for his success. He&#x2019;d been a standout student at the University of Chicago&#x2019;s prestigious economics department in the early 1990s, then a star at Goldman Sachs in the mid-1990s before branching out on his own in 1998 to launch AQR with $1 billion and change, a near record at the time. His ego had grown along with his wallet, and so, too, had his temper. While outsiders knew Asness for his razor-sharp mind tempered by a wry, self-effacing sense of humor, inside AQR he was known for flying into computer-smashing rampages and shooting off ego-crushing emails to his cowed employees at all hours of the day or night. His poker buddies loved Asness&#x2019;s cutting wit and encyclopedic memory, but they&#x2019;d also seen his darker side, his volatile temper and sudden rages at a losing hand.</p><h2>50 Physics Ideas You Really Need to Know (50 Ideas)</h2><p>As well as outlining and explaining such historic breakthroughs in human understanding of the physical world as Kepler&#x2019;s law of planetary motion and Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation, Joanne Baker unravels the sometimes baffling complexities of modern scientific theory from Planck&#x2019;s law to Pauli&#x2019;s exclusion principle and from Schrondinger&#x2019;s cat to string theory.

Within the space of three years, Sonia Choquette had suffered the unexpected death of two close family members, seen her marriage implode, and been let down by trusted colleagues. And sympathy was not forthcoming. "You&#x2019;re a world-renowned spiritual teacher and intuitive guide," people jeered. "How could you not have seen this coming?" Having intuitive abilities didn&#x2019;t make her superhuman, however. Nor did it exempt her from being wounded or suffering the pain of loss and the consequences of our all-too-human traits such as anger, resentment, and pride&#x2014;traits that can lead even the best of us to stray from our spiritual path. In order to regain her spiritual footing, Sonia turned to the age-old practice of pilgrimage and set out to walk the legendary Camino de Santiago, an 820-kilometer trek over the Pyrenees and across northern Spain. Day after day she pushed through hunger, exhaustion, and pain to reach her destination.

That book presented the letters of the prominent Presbyterian minister and plantation patriarch Charles Colcock Jones (1804 1863), whose family owned more than one hundred slaves. While extensive, these letters can provide only one part of the story of the Jones family plantations in coastal Georgia. In this remarkable new book, the religious historian Erskine Clarke completes the story, offering a narrative history of four generations of the plantations&#x2019; inhabitants, white <i>and </i>black.<br>Encompassing the years 1805 to 1869, <i>Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic </i>describes the simultaneous but vastly different experiences of slave and slave owner. This upstairsdownstairs&#x201d; history reveals in detail how the benevolent impulses of Jones and his family became ideological supports for deep oppression, and how the slave Lizzy Jones and members of her family struggled against that oppression. Through letters, plantation and church records, court documents, slave narratives, archaeological findings, and the memory of the African-American community, Clarke brings to light the long-suppressed history of the slaves of the Jones plantations a history inseparably bound to that of their white owners.<p></p></p><p>Q: You&#x2019;ve been working on this book for a decade. How did you first come to this story?<p></p>A: <i>I began my research with the intention of writing a biography of Charles Colcock Jones, Sr. The monumental collection of the Jones family letters in </i>Children of Pride <i>covered only the last part of Jones&#x2019;s life, but did not include the critical earlier years of his work among the Gullah people of the Georgia coast. The family papers included thousands of letters, extensive plantation records, journals, sermons preached to slaves, and documents describing slave life. A fascinating story of a wealthy, pious, and influential low-country community began to emerge. The Jones family, like many of their white planting neighbors, were highly literate, deeply committed to the public good of their white community, and convinced that slavery provided a necessary training period for African Americans on their way to some distant freedom.<p></p></i>Q: While the stories of white plantation owners are fairly well documented, the lives of their slaves are not. How did you reconstruct the lives of these individuals?<p></p>A: <i>As I moved deeper into the documents, I began to discover individual African Americans emerging into plain view individuals with names, with histories, with distinctive traits and varied ways of resisting the deep oppression of slavery. While I knew that a great distance separated me from these Gullah people, I felt an increasing compulsion to try as best I could to tell their story too. And so I decided to attempt a kind of upstairs-downstairs history.<p></p>One story would be told from the perspective of whites who saw the low country from the piazzas of plantation homes. The other story would be told from the perspective of blacks who saw it from around the communal fires of slave settlements. In the end, I found I could not write a biography of Charles Jones without also writing about the life and struggles of Cato and Cassius, Patience and Phoebe, and the dense network of Gullah people who in their labors and resistance to slavery built their own remarkable community and culture.<p></p></i><b>Erskine Clarke</b> is professor of American religious history, Columbia Theological Seminary.<p></p></p><h2>Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object</h2><p>An anthropological study of time, and how it is employed, to discuss humans and human endeavors.</p><p>Fabian's study is a classic in the field that changed the way anthropologists relate to their subjects and is of immense value not only to anthropologists but to all those concerned with the study of man.

Sandra Harding introduces and discusses an array of postcolonial science studies, and their implications for "northern" science. All three science studies strains have developed in the context of post-World War II science and technology projects. They illustrate how technoscientific projects mean different things to different groups. The meaning attached by the culture of the West may not be shared or may be diametrically opposite in the cultures in other parts of the world. All, however, would agree that scientific projects&#x2015;modern science included&#x2015;are "local knowledge systems." The interests and discursive resources that the various science studies bring groups to their projects, and the ways that they organize the production of their kind of science studies, are distinctively culturally-local also. While their projects may be unintentionally converging, they also conflict in fundamental respects.<br>How is this inevitable cultural-situatedness of knowledge both an invaluable resource as well as a limitation on the advance of knowledge about nature? What are the distinctive resources that the feminist and postcolonial science theorists offer in thinking about the history of modern science; the diversity of "scientific" traditions in non-European as well as in European cultures; and the directions that might be taken by less androcentric and Eurocentric scientific projects? How might modern sciences&#x2019; projects be linked more firmly to the prodemocratic yearnings that are so widely voiced in contemporary life? Carefully balancing poststructuralist and conventional epistemological resources, this study concludes by proposing new directions for thinking about objectivity, method, and reflexivity in light of the new understandings developed in the post-World War II world.</p></p><p><p>SANDRA HARDING, a philosopher, is Professor of Education and Women Studies at UCLA.

Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day. Shauna Summers, Senior EditorLady Mary Stewart is one of our most successful novelists.

Along with way, he opens to us the mysteries of fish tails, frog calls, and other matters, and shows once and for all why we must take notice when a seemingly insignificant creature is threatened, like the land snail <em>Partula</em> from Moorea, whose extinction he movingly relates.<br></p><p>Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002) was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Geology at Harvard University. He published over twenty books, received the National Book and National Book Critics Circle Awards, and a MacArthur Fellowship.With expected wit, insight, and erudition, Harvard geopaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould ( Bully for Brontosaurus , LJ 5/15/91) has written 31 engaging essays on the disparate but related issues of time, change, and organic evolution. Gould critically explores a cascade of ideas that shed new light on ecology, human nature, vertebrate anatomy, neo-Darwinism, and mass extinctions; he even includes personal musings. Of special interest are the essays that deal with William Paley's natural theology, Archbishop James Ussher's biblical chronology, Miocene fossil apes, the Darwinian interpretation of life's struggle for existence, and a reexamination of the Cambrian onychophoran Hallucigenia . Gould respects the scientific quest but has disdain for human intolerance. His own model of organic evolution permeates these analyses (see Wonderful Life , LJ 9/1/89).

Bush<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Surge</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Years from now, historians may look back and see the surge as a forgone conclusion, an inevitable bridge between the years of violence that followed liberation and the democracy that emerged. Nothing about the surge felt inevitable at the time. Public opinion ran strongly against it. Congress tried to block it. The enemy fought relentlessly to break our will.<br>Yet thanks to the skill and courage of our troops, the new counterinsurgency strategy we adopted, the superb coordination between our civilian and military efforts, and the strong support we provided for Iraq&#x2019;s political leaders, a war widely written off as a failure has a chance to end in success. By the time I left office, the violence had declined dramatically. Economic and political activity had resumed. Al Qaeda had suffered a significant military and ideological defeat. In March 2010, Iraqis went to the polls again. In a headline unimaginable three years earlier, <i>Newsweek </i>ran a cover story titled &#x201c;Victory at Last: The Emergence of a Democratic Iraq.&#x201d;<br>Iraq still faces challenges, and no one can know with certainty what the fate of the country will be. But we do know this: Because the United States liberated Iraq and then refused to abandon it, the people of that country have a chance to be free. Having come this far, I hope America will continue to support Iraq&#x2019;s young democracy. If Iraqis request a continued troop presence, we should provide it. A free and peaceful Iraq is in our vital strategic interest. It can be a valuable ally at the heart of the Middle East, a source of stability in the region, and a beacon of hope to political reformers in its neighborhood and around the world. Like the democracies we helped build in Germany, Japan, and South Korea, a free Iraq will make us safer for generations to come.<br>I have often reflected on whether I should have ordered the surge earlier. For three years, our premise in Iraq was that political progress was the measure of success. The Iraqis hit all their milestones on time. It looked like our strategy was working. Only after the sectarian violence erupted in 2006 did it become clear that more security was needed before political progress could continue. After that, I moved forward with the surge in a way that unified our government. If I had acted sooner it could have created a rift that would have been exploited by war critics in Congress to cut off funding and prevent the surge from succeeding.<br>From the beginning of the war in Iraq, my conviction was that freedom is universal&#x2014;and democracy in the Middle East would make the region more peaceful. There were times when that seemed unlikely. But I never lost faith that it was true.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Financial Crisis</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mr<b>. </b>President, we are witnessing a financial panic.&#x201d;<br>Those were troubling words coming from Ben Bernanke, the mild-mannered chairman of the Federal Reserve, who was seated across from me in the Roosevelt Room. Over the previous two weeks, the government had seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two giant housing entities. Lehman Brothers had filed the largest bankruptcy in American history. Merrill Lynch had been sold under duress. The Fed had granted an $85 billion loan to save AIG. Now Wachovia and Washington Mutual were teetering on the brink of collapse.<br>With so much turbulence in financial institutions, credit markets had seized up. Consumers couldn&#x2019;t get loans for homes or cars. Small businesses couldn&#x2019;t borrow to finance their operations. The stock market had taken its steepest plunge since the first day of trading after 9/11.<br>As we sat beneath the oil painting of Teddy Roosevelt charging on horseback, we all knew America was facing its most dire economic challenge in decades.<br>I turned to the Rough Rider of my financial team, Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, a natural leader with decades of experience in international finance.<br>&#x201c;The situation is extraordinarily serious,&#x201d; Hank said. <br>He and the team briefed me on three measures to stem the crisis. First, the Treasury would guarantee all $3.5 trillion in money market mutual funds, which were facing depositor runs. Second, the Fed would launch a program to unfreeze the market for commercial paper, a key source of financing for businesses across the country. Third, the Securities and Exchange Commission would issue a rule temporarily preventing the short-selling of financial stocks. <br>&#x201c;These are dramatic steps,&#x201d; Hank said, &#x201c;but America&#x2019;s financial system is at stake.&#x201d;<br>He outlined an even bolder proposal. &#x201c;We need broad authority to buy mortgage-backed securities,&#x201d; he said. Those complex financial assets had lost value when the housing bubble burst, imperiling the balance sheets of financial firms around the world. Hank recommended that we ask Congress for hundreds of billions to buy up these toxic assets and restore confidence in the banking system.<br>&#x201c;Is this the worst crisis since the Great Depression?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Ben replied. &#x201c;In terms of the financial system, we have not seen anything like this since the 1930s, and it could get worse.&#x201d;<br>His answer clarified the decision I faced: Did I want to be the president overseeing an economic calamity that could be worse than the Great Depression?<br>I was furious the situation had reached this point. A relatively small group of people&#x2014;many on Wall Street, some not&#x2014;had gambled that the housing market would keep booming forever. It didn&#x2019;t. In a normal environment, the free market would render its judgment and they could fail. I would have been happy to let them do so.<br>But this was not a normal environment. The market had ceased to function. And as Ben had explained, the consequences of inaction would be catastrophic. As unfair as it was to use the American people&#x2019;s money to prevent a collapse for which they weren&#x2019;t responsible, it would be even more unfair to do nothing and leave them to suffer the consequences.<br>&#x201c;Get to work,&#x201d; I said, approving Hank&#x2019;s plan in full. &#x201c;We are going to solve this.&#x201d;<br>I adjourned the meeting and walked across the hallway to the Oval Office. Josh Bolten, Counselor Ed Gillespie, and Dana Perino, my talented and effective press secretary, followed me in. Ben&#x2019;s historical comparison was still echoing in my mind.<br>&#x201c;If we&#x2019;re really looking at another Great Depression,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you can be damn sure I&#x2019;m going to be Roosevelt, not Hoover.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Biblical Exegesis, Revised Edition</h2><p>The new edition retains the features of the first edition: a minimum of technical terms, solid introductory guidelines in exegetical method, and a valuable presentation of exgetical theory and practice.

Born in Paris, Goscinny lived in Buenos Aires and New York before returning to France in the 1950s where he met Semp�. They collaborated on picture strips and then stories about Nicholas. An internationally successful children's author, he also won awards for his animated cartoons. <p> Jean-Jacques Semp� (b. 1932) is one of the most successful and best-loved cartoonists and illustrators in the world.

Each chapter opens with a few sentences from Nicholas or excerpts from correspondence between the boy and his parents. Nicholas's forthright voice is full of childlike repetition and exclamations ("fantastic!"). This book isn't notable for its plot. The stories are simple, relating Nicholas's antics when he and his parents travel to the seaside and then when he goes to his first overnight camp. What distinguishes this title is a narrative that captures a child so believably and allows its readers to relate to the action but also at times to see beyond what Nicholas himself sees. Semp�'s charming cartoon illustrations appear throughout and reinforce the tone. The strength of voice, multilayered humor, short chapters, and episodic nature of the text make <i>Nicholas on Vacation</i> an ideal family or classroom read-aloud. It may take some selling, but it's well worth a place on library shelves.&#x2014;<i>Adrienne Furness, Webster Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her books have been translated into 18 languages and made into a television series. She was born in G�teborg, Sweden, where she now lives with her husband.The Huss family was celebrating. As one might expect, given their connections to the restaurant business, the table was adorned with artistically folded linen napkins and flickering candles, along with a range of glasses and cutlery to go with each course. Needless to say the menu was pretty special too, thanks to the two chefs in the family.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krister raised his glass and cleared his throat. &#x201c;Right now we have plenty to celebrate. Jenny, your mom and I are so pleased that you&#x2019;ve completed your training to become a chef, and found an apartment and a job. Congratulations!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone joined in the toast, sipping vintage Champagne, while Jenny stuck to alcohol-free cider. When she was a teenager she had followed a strict vegan diet. Her training in vegetarian cuisine had softened her approach somewhat, but she still refused to touch alcohol.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Krister allowed the delicious sparkling wine to linger on his palate for a moment.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And of course we want to congratulate Katarina and Felipe, even though it&#x2019;s been a month since you got engaged. We wish you every happiness!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once again the glasses were raised. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And on Wednesday Irene and I celebrated our silver wedding anniversary. Twenty-five years. And you&#x2019;ve been with us for twenty-four of those years,&#x201d; Krister went on, winking at his daughters.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wasn&#x2019;t quite true; the twins had been there throughout their marriage. Irene recalled the wedding photo with a shudder; she had been seven months pregnant, and had looked like the battleship <i>Potemkin </i>in the full-length shot. She hadn&#x2019;t framed it, but had chosen a close-up where she and Krister were both smiling into the camera. We were so young, she often thought when she glanced at the picture. She had been almost a year younger than the twins were now when she became a mother. Somehow they had managed to steer their little family through a quarter of a century; it hadn&#x2019;t always been easy, but now it seemed as if things were beginning to fall into place for all of them&#x2014;not least Krister.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;My turn, I think,&#x201d; Irene said, smiling at her husband. He rolled his eyes, but couldn&#x2019;t hide his pleasure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We all want to congratulate you, my darling, on becoming the owner of Glady&#x2019;s. You&#x2019;ve run the place for many years, so I have no doubt that it will be a success. Here&#x2019;s to you, my love!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With that she kissed Krister on the lips as the others whistled and cheered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why did M�nsson suddenly decided to sell the place to you?&#x201d; Jenny asked when things calmed down.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krister&#x2019;s expression immediately grew serious.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have a choice. I had no idea, but apparently he gambled, and he was heavily in debt. That was the reason behind the divorce, and that was also why he moved here just under two years ago. He must have gotten a good price for the restaurants he owned in Stockholm, because he was able to pay off his debts and buy both Glady&#x2019;s and Sj�krogen. Or maybe he borrowed some of the money . . . I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So now he&#x2019;s sold both restaurants here in G�teborg in order to pay off new debts?&#x201d; Katarina said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Presumably. He had some counseling to help him beat his addiction back in the spring, and he seems to have sorted out his finances; he and his new girlfriend . . . what was her name . . . Jeanette Stenberg, that&#x2019;s it. She worked as head waitress at Glady&#x2019;s for a while before she took over at Sj�krogen, that&#x2019;s how I know her. Nice girl.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Krister took a sip of Champagne before going on:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Anyway, Janne and Jeanette are moving to Majorca on Monday. He called me yesterday to say goodbye. He was still packing and I was working, so we didn&#x2019;t even manage to get together for a beer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What are they going to do over there?&#x201d; Irene was curious.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&#x2019;t know Jan-Erik M�nsson very well; he was an old friend of Krister&#x2019;s. They had worked well together in Stockholm, and had become friends. Irene and Krister had met while she was doing her police training in Stockholm, and she had seen Janne a few times. He was a friendly, likeable, outgoing guy. When Irene completed her training she wanted to move back to G�teborg, and Krister joined her. Janne worked overseas for a few years, then returned to the capital where he had a brilliant career. A lot of people were surprised when he suddenly sold his two-star restaurants and relocated to G�teborg, his hometown, following his divorce.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to run a restaurant in an upmarket hotel in a small town called Puerto Pollensa. Apparently the owner is an old friend of Janne&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Krister said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was time to serve the starter. Krister headed for the kitchen to grill Jenny&#x2019;s herb and tofu stuffed tomatoes and the omnivores&#x2019; lobster, almost tripping over Egon, who suddenly appeared, moving at top speed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Egon!&#x201d; Krister exclaimed, saving himself by grabbing hold of the doorpost.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The little dachshund stopped dead. In his mouth he was carrying his beloved blue ball, which he had inherited from Sammie, the family&#x2019;s first dog. He sat down and tilted his head to one side, his tail swishing to and fro as he kept his eyes expectantly fixed on his master. Naturally Krister melted as usual. He bent down and picked up the dog.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not now, little man. Later. Let&#x2019;s find you some food first,&#x201d; he said, burying his nose in Egon&#x2019;s soft coat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word &#x201c;later&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t part of Egon&#x2019;s vocabulary, but he heard &#x201c;food&#x201d; very clearly and started yapping. It was one of his favorite words.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come and feed Egon so you can concentrate on dinner,&#x201d; Irene said, getting to her feet.<br><br>*<br><br> Through the half-open bedroom door, Irene watched as Egon scrambled up onto the bed. He belched a couple of times, then rolled over on his back with his paws in the air. His meal of dog biscuits mixed with morsels of tender saddle of venison had obviously been delicious; he had eaten every scrap and licked the bowl clean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Egon fell asleep on the bed as the conversation and laughter continued in the living room.<br>&nbsp; <br>*<br><br> The insistent sound of the telephone woke<br> Irene early on Sunday morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Leave it,&#x201d; Krister murmured, trying to pull her close.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. It might be important,&#x201d; Irene said, fumbling for the receiver. Her head felt heavy, and she knew she had drunk more than usual the previous evening. But it had been a family party; they didn&#x2019;t get together very often now that the girls were grown up and living their own lives. It was hard to find an opportunity when everyone was available at the same time.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glance at the alarm clock told her she had slept for less than four hours, so it was hardly surprising she wasn&#x2019;t firing on all cylinders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Irene Huss,&#x201d; she said, trying to sound brighter than she felt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Morning&#x2014;it&#x2019;s Fredrik. I&#x2019;m really sorry, but you&#x2019;re going to have to come in today,&#x201d; said Detective Inspector Fredrik Stridh, as full of life as ever.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s my day off. Krister and I celebrated our silver wedding anniversary yesterday.&#x201d; Irene didn&#x2019;t even try to hide the yawn that made her jawbone crack.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re a little the worse for wear? I do understand, but there&#x2019;s no one else. Hannu, Sara and Jonny are still on vacation. I&#x2019;ve checked the roster; Jonny and Sara are due back tomorrow, but I can&#x2019;t get hold of either of them. I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re the only member of the team who&#x2019;s available.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Krister had been right; she shouldn&#x2019;t have answered the phone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Okay. What&#x2019;s it about?&#x201d; she said with an audible sigh.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There was a barbecue at Gothia MC&#x2019;s old place out at Ring�n late last night,&#x201d; Fredrik replied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A barbecue?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They decided to flame-grill some guy.&#x201d;</p><h2>Servsafe Coursebook</h2><p>ServSafe Coursebook by National Restaurant Association, ..

Not yet even thirty years old, he&#x2019;s won the most crushing naval victories in human history. He&#x2019;s smashed a hostile alliance of no less than five princedoms and won the hand of the beautiful young Queen Sharleyan of Chisholm. Cayleb and Sharleyan have created the Charisian Empire, the greatest naval power in the history of Safehold, and they&#x2019;ve turned Charis into a place of refuge for all who treasure freedom.<br><br>Their success may prove short-lived. The Church of God Awaiting, which controls most of Safehold, has decreed their destruction. Mother Church&#x2019;s entire purpose is to prevent the very things to which Charis is committed. Since the first attempt to crush the heretics failed, the Church has no choice but to adopt some of the hated Charisian innovations for themselves. Soon a mighty fleet will sail against Cayleb, destroying everything in its path.<br><br>But there are still matters about which the Church knows nothing, including Cayleb and Sharleyan&#x2019;s adviser, friend, and guardian&#x2014; the mystic warrior-monk named Merlin Athrawes. Merlin knows all about battles against impossible odds, because he is in fact the cybernetic avatar of a young woman named Nimue Alban, who died a thousand years before. As Nimue, Merlin saw the entire Terran Federation go down in fire and slaughter at the hands of a foe it could not defeat. He knows that Safehold is the last human planet in existence, and that the stasis the Church was created to enforce will be the human race&#x2019;s death sentence if it is allowed to stand.<br><br>The juggernaut is rumbling down on Charis, but Merlin Athrawes and a handful of extraordinary human beings stand in its path. The Church is about to discover just how potent the power of human freedom truly is.</p><p><b>David Weber</b>&nbsp;is a science fiction phenomenon and the author of the Safehold series, including <i>Off Armageddon Reef</i>, <i>By Schism Rent Asunder</i>, and <i>By Heresies Distressed</i>.

He lives in South Carolina.*Starred Review* No one can doubt where the title of Weber&#x2019;s new novel of the planet Safehold comes from, nor, reading it, be surprised that Cayleb Ahrmahk is happy as a grig (Middle English word; look it up) to be the greatest naval hero in Safehold history and husband of the beautiful Queen Sharleyan, hence co-ruler of the Charisian Empire. The Church of God Awaiting, however, is determined to bring the whole planet of Safehold under its sway, with disastrous implications for the survival of humanity. It is even prepared to take to the high seas with a vast armada using technology that centuries of effort have been spent trying to limit. Cayleb still has the warrior monk Merlin at hand, however, and it begins to look as though the latter isn&#x2019;t the only echo of the Matter of Britain in this saga that combines superb action sf elements and (surprise!) homage to the great novels of the Age of Fighting Sail (by C. S. Forester, Patrick O&#x2019;Brian, and their ilk). Weber has an enormous audience that welcomes each enormous book because Weber&#x2019;s very real wit manages to do very well without the assistance of brevity. --Roland Green</p><h2>The Heroic Symphony</h2><p>When Beethoven learns he is going deaf, he is determined to write a great symphony. As war rages in Europe he thinks he has found his inspiration in the heroic deeds of Napoleon. But has he?</p><p>Anna Harwell Celenza is a musicologist and the author of several books for adults and children regarding music history and the history of art. Her children&#x2019;s books include THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY, PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION, GERSHWIN'S RHAPSODY IN BLUE, and VIVALDI'S FOUR SEASONS. Anna lives in Baltimore, Maryland.Kindergarten-Grade 4--As in their previous collaborations, Celenza brings a famous musician to life while Kitchel provides energetic art. This time, they present the story of Beethoven's despair over his deafness and his eventual triumph as he gives himself over to the symphony that highlights his struggle to survive as a musician. Originally written as a celebration of Napoleon's victory, the four movements were meant to reflect Bonaparte's courage and heroism. Soon after Beethoven completed them, however, he discovered the great warrior's treachery in declaring himself Emperor of France. The composer ripped a copy of the score he had intended as a gift, but his friend Ferdinand Ries prevented him from destroying the composition. The <i>Bonaparte</i> Symphony was later renamed the <i>Eroica</i>, or <i>Heroic</i>Symphony. Celenza's research into the details of this piece of music reflects her scholarly background; she unearthed primary-source material that is described in an author's note. The stylized watercolor-and-ink paintings evoke the mood of each movement; for the first one, Napoleon's horse seems to jump right out of the musical score. To reflect the French origins of the symphony, Kitchel backs most of the illustrations with a toile design. Although there are many books on this composer, such as Barbara Nichol's <i>Beethoven Lives Upstairs</i> (Orchard, 1994) and Mike Venezia's <i>Ludwig vanBeethoven</i>(Children's, 1996), this one, with its emphasis on one segment of his life, is a worthwhile purchase.<i>--Laurie Edwards, West Shore School District, Camp Hill, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hugh Thomas has written a rich and riveting narrative of exploration, progress, and plunder. At its center is the unforgettable ruler who fought the French and expanded the Spanish empire, and the bold conquistadors who were his agents. Thomas brings to life King Charles V&#x2014;first as a gangly and easygoing youth, then as a liberal statesman who exceeded all his predecessors in his ambitions for conquest (while making sure to maintain the humanity of his new subjects in the Americas), and finally as a besieged Catholic leader obsessed with Protestant heresy and interested only in profiting from those he presided over.<br><br><i>The Golden Empire</i> also presents the legendary men whom King Charles V sent on perilous and unprecedented expeditions: Hern�n Cort�s, who ruled the &#x201c;New Spain&#x201d; of Mexico as an absolute monarch&#x2014;and whose rebuilding of its capital, Tenochtitlan, was Spain&#x2019;s greatest achievement in the sixteenth century; Francisco Pizarro, who set out with fewer than two hundred men for Peru, infamously executed the last independent Inca ruler, Atahualpa, and was finally murdered amid intrigue; and Hernando de Soto, whose glittering journey to settle land between Rio de la Palmas in Mexico and the southernmost keys of Florida ended in disappointment and death. Hugh Thomas reveals as never before their torturous journeys through jungles, their brutal sea voyages amid appalling storms and pirate attacks, and how a cash-hungry Charles backed them with loans&#x2014;and bribes&#x2014;obtained from his German banking friends.<br><br>A sweeping, compulsively readable saga of kings and conquests, armies and armadas, dominance and power, <i>The Golden Empire</i> is a crowning achievement of the Spanish world&#x2019;s foremost historian.</p><p><b>Hugh Thomas</b> is the author of numerous histories, including <i>Rivers of Gold,</i> a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book and one of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>&#x2019;s Best Books of the Year; <i>The Spanish Civil War,</i> for which he won the Somerset Maugham Award; and <i>An Unfinished&nbsp;History of the World,</i> for which he won the Arts Council Prize for History.

Cort�s, who looked on himself as Charles's agent, had both discovered and conquered a great indigenous empire: a regime marked by a sophisticated culture allied to barbarism. In 1522, he was the commander of a small successful Spanish army of about two thousand men, with the assistance of numerous indigenous allies, who relished the chance of rebellion and revenge against their old suzerains, the Aztecs (the Mexica). He was surrounded by a praetorian guard of about five hundred horsemen and four thousand foot, all the latter being Indians. He had no title to any command, but all the same, in the ruins of the old Mexican capital he had all the power. The new world was an echo of the old: Cort�s was a great European commander who had conquered indigenous people. He had given the territory the name New Spain, no less, which would remain its designation for three hundred years.<br><br>His chief captains (such as the Alvarado brothers, Gonzalo de Sandoval, and Andr�s de Tapia) were his political subordinates as well as his military deputies. One or two of these commanders had good connections in Spain: For example, Jer�nimo Ruiz de la Mota was the first cousin of the Emperor Charles's preceptor, the bishop of Palencia, and Bernardino V�zquez de Tapia was the nephew of a member of the Council of Castile, Pedro (V�zquez) de Oropesa. Several of Cort�s's best-connected commanders had returned to Spain to spread news of what he had done: Francisco de Montejo, of Salamanca, for example, and Alonso Hern�ndez Portocarrero, a cousin of the count of Medell�n and a nephew of Judge de las Gradas in Seville; as well as Diego de Ordaz of Le�n, who had returned to Spain the previous year, in search of preferments of his own.<br><br>Cort�s knew that what he had done was astonishing; and he had begun to conduct himself self-consciously in the shadow of Alexander the Great, Caesar, or even the Argonauts. The defeated Mexica had been humbled, many had been killed, and several members of the late Emperor Montezuma's family had accepted the Spaniards as their new rulers: These included Montezuma's son, Don Pedro Montezuma, who must be supposed to have been his heir, and his daughter, Do�a Isabel or Techuipo. There was also Cihuacoatl (Tlacotzin), the majordomo of the old government, who was now working for Cort�s in the ruined city of Tenochtitlan. The other defeated rulers of old Mexico-such as the monarch of Tlacopan and Tacuba, Tetlepanqueltzatzin, along with his colleague, the monarch of Texcoco, Ixtlilxochitl, and above all the tragic Cuauht�moc, Montezuma's successor as the ruler of Tenochtitlan- were prisoners of Cort�s. In the immediate aftermath of the Spanish victory, Cuauht�moc had been tortured by the royal treasurer, Juli�n de Alderete, of Tordesillas, to cause him to reveal the whereabouts of hidden gold and other treasure. Cort�s had accepted that, for he badly needed something to offer his victorious but restless fellow conquistadors. But he does not seem to have initiated the cruelty.<br><br>Cort�s was the despot of the new territory that he had conquered. A great many people had died in the fighting leading to this despotism, mostly Mexican natives, but also perhaps one thousand Spaniards. That had not been Cort�s's intention. He had thought that he could overwhelm the empire of the Mexica by kidnapping its ruler. Charles the Emperor would rule New Spain through Montezuma. This scheme had been thwarted in 1520 by P�nfilo de Narv�ez, Cort�s's Segovia-born rival, in the first pitched battle between Spaniards in the Americas. Fighting began between Indians and Spaniards because of Pedro de Alvarado's fatal preemptive strike, as the twenty-first century would have put the matter (he anticipated an Indian mutiny). Cort�s had wanted control, power, authority, not bloodshed or massacre.<br><br>In early 1522, Cort�s was still awaiting a reaction from the Emperor Charles to the news of his astonishing victory, details of which he had sent by letter the previous year-a manuscript letter, of course, like everything from the Indies. The delay was not surprising, since though the surrender of Tenochtitlan had been on August 13, 1521, a report of that event did not reach Spain till March 1522. Charles was still in the Low Countries and would not return to Spain till the summer of that year. Cort�s had planned that his report would be accompanied not only by Alonso de �vila; his secretary, Juan de Ribera; and the chief of his bodyguard, Qui�ones, but by a substantial treasure seized from the Mexica: 50,000 pesos in gold, of which the Crown would receive 9,000 pesos, many large pearls, much jade, several obsidian mirrors framed in gold, and even three jaguars. There were also many presents of plumage in the form of turquoise mosaics, cloaks, cotton cloths, painted maps, ornamental shields, and elaborately constructed parrots and crickets of gold and silver. These were all to go to friends of Cort�s, to influential Spanish officials, to noblemen and sacred places, to monasteries and churches.<br><br>Many conquistadors would take the opportunity to send back to Spain gold to their relations. Most promising of presents in the long run perhaps was a rubber ball, such as used by the Indians in their strange but elaborate wall game. This would constitute one of the Americas' most notable gifts to the Old World.<br><br>Alas, much of this treasure was seized by French adventurers led by the piratical Jean Florin, acting on behalf of his master, Jean Ango, between the Azores and Spain, and the expedition home suffered other setbacks. But a brief letter from Cort�s describing the final conquest of the Mexica did at last arrive in Spain in March 1522.<br><br>Before Cort�s's detailed account in this, his "third letter," reached the court, however, in November 1522, Charles the King and Emperor had made several critical decisions. After meeting with those members of the Council of Castile who had come to deal with matters relating to the Indies, Cort�s was, on October 11, 1522-that is, a month before his report arrived-named adelantado (commander in chief with proconsular responsibilities), repartidor (distributor) of Indians, and also governor and Captain-General of New Spain. That seemed to represent a political triumph for Cort�s, since it formally released him from any subservience to his old master, the governor of Cuba, Diego Vel�zquez. It was also a victory since it accepted Cort�s's grand name for the new land: "New Spain," a designation that indicated the supranational character of this new monarchy of Castile. It seemed, too, to give Cort�s complete command: governor and Captain- General were substantial titles.<br><br>The territory covered by his appointment was, however, vague: No one knew where Cort�s's dominions began and ended. But it was assumed that at the least he would control the allies who had helped him so much in his conquest; not just the lords of the valley of Mexico who had been liberated from the yoke of the Mexica but also the Totonaca and the Tlaxcalteca and most of the five hundred other tribes established in the mainland of old Mexico.<br><br>A decree issued four days later instructed Cort�s about the proper treatment of the Indians and talked of grants of government money to finance representatives (procuradores) of New Spain in Castile. This decree had the advantage of accepting Cort�s's judgment of the coming of Narv�ez to New Spain in 1520: "The journey of P�nfilo de Narv�ez and his fleet was the reason for the rebellion and temporary loss of the great city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan." Charles also wrote to Cort�s speaking warmly of his achievements. The latter could no longer complain about a lack of appreciation at home, though these decrees, and the Emperor's letter, did not reach New Spain till September 1523, partly because of the curiously dilatory conduct of the messengers, Cort�s's cousins Rodrigo de Paz and Francisco de las Casas. They took an unconscionably long time to set off and decided to travel via Cuba, where they took the bad news of the success of "Cortesillo," as Cort�s once had been known in Cuba, to the governor, Diego Vel�zquez. He was distressed.<br><br>The Emperor Charles accompanied his praise for Cort�s and his acceptance of him as his governor in New Spain with the nomination of four officials whose task would be to assist Cort�s in administration of the new provinces. These were a new treasurer, Alonso de Estrada; a factor, or general administrator of the new empire, Gonzalo de Salazar; an inspector of administration, Pedro �lvarez de Chirino; and an accountant, Rodrigo de Albornoz.<br><br>These men were important. Estrada had been in Flanders, admiral at M�laga and then corregidor (representative of the central government) in C�ceres. He was a permanent councillor in his native city, Ciudad Real. He would boast that he was an illegitimate son of the late King Fernando, and perhaps he was. Salazar was a Granadino but his family was originally from Burgos. He had been an attendant in the royal household and went to New Spain with quite a retinue. �lvarez de Chirino came from �beda and was seen as the agent of the principal royal secretary, Francisco de los Cobos, the powerful if unimaginative official who dominated that city politically and socially. The fourth official, Rodrigo de Albornoz, was probably from Lugo in Galicia, and seems to have also held a minor position in the court of Spain. He was asked by the Italian courtier Peter Martyr to send home reports by cipher about Cort�s's activities. Martyr once talked of Cort�s's craftiness, his avarice, and his "partially revealed tyranny."<br><br>The nomination of these four courtly men to New Spain certainly showed that the Crown was taking the conquests of Cort�s seriously. Yet they were obviously intended to control that conqueror and prevent him from undue assertion of his own authority. But these new councillors, like Paz and Las Casas before them, took a long time to reach the new country. Long before they arrived, Cort�s had embarked on his greatest work of art and Spain's greatest achievement in the Americas in the sixteenth century: the rebuilding of the city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Mexica, which had been severely damaged during the fighting there between May and August 1521. (The Spaniards referred to this city as Temixtlan till 1524, when it gradually became known as Mexico.)<br><br>Cort�s had been recommended by some of his friends and fellow conquistadors to rebuild the capital of New Spain in a place removed from the lake of Tenochtitlan, say at Tacuba or Coyoac�n. They had argued that the old capital was exposed to the dangers of flooding, as had occurred on a large scale in 1502. Since the environs were swampy, there would always be difficulties of water supply. The critics argued that Coyoac�n would be a more suitable site for a capital, as Cort�s had surely appreciated since he had established his residence there after 1521 on the southern shores of the lake in a large, cool, spacious mansion built for him immediately after his victory in 1521. But in January 1522, Cort�s went ahead with his plan to rebuild on the old site despite these criticisms.<br><br>Some enemies of Cort�s thought that their leader must be trying to arrange defenses in order to resist any attempt to detach him from power. He decided to rebuild where he did, however, because of the legendary nature of the site of Tenochtitlan. He did not want to leave the place a monument to past glory. The Indians wanted to rebuild, too, and a good workforce for the purpose was easily assembled.<br><br>The essential part in the reconstruction was played by a "geometrician" named Alonso Garc�a Bravo, who had been born in Rivera, on the road between M�laga and Ronda, in Andalusia, and had educated himself in matters of town planning even before he left Castile in 1513 with Pedrarias. Garc�a Bravo reached New Spain with the expedition of Francisco de Garay and subsequently joined Cort�s's army. He took part in several battles as a conquistador, but then went to Villa Rica, Veracruz. He remained there during the siege of Tenochtitlan, having been asked to design its planned fortress.<br><br>The success of the building at Veracruz led Cort�s to ask him to direct the reconstruction of Tenochtitlan. He went up to the capital in the summer of 1522 and studied the ground with Cort�s himself. The city had been fought over fiercely. There had been much destruction, since Cort�s had felt the need to destroy lines of two-story buildings to prevent the Indians dropping rocks on his men from above. Sometimes the Spaniards had used artillery in these endeavors. But the overall destruction had probably been more modest than has often been supposed. The causeways, the main streets, and the remains of many buildings were all evident even if the two main shrines of ancient Mexico, in the heart of Tenochtitlan and in Tlatelolco, had been damaged.<br><br>Garc�a Bravo's first commission was to build a fortress with two towers, at the eastern end of the city, beyond the ruins of the old Templo Mayor. This was a maritime station (atarazanas), where Cort�s could keep his thirteen brigantines, built under the direction of the clever but embittered Sevillano Mart�n L�pez, which had played such an important part in assuring the Spanish victory over the Mexica. Again, Cort�s's enemies later argued, unjustifiably, the construction of these towers was an act directed against the royal power. These buildings were built under the supervision of Cihuacoatl (Tlacotzin), the high priest of the Mexica and now a rather improbable collaborator with the victors. One tower was high and had lodgings within it.<br><br>In planning the main reconstruction of the capital, Garc�a Bravo proposed to accept the basic structure of the old Mexican city with its causeways and canals leading to a walled center, which in the past had been a sacred precinct, with the great pyramid and its sanctuaries. From all sides one saw the huge bulk of the great pyramid. The sacred precinct was approached by three causeways: to the north, the west, and the south. To the east, there was no communication with the mainland. The causeway to the north was aesthetically planned, since the direct way-via Tepeyac, now the site of the shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe-would have been a parallel road a little to the east. To the south, beyond the walls of the city, there was a large marketplace where Indian buyers and sellers were busy within days of the conquest, on August 13, 1521.<br><br>Around this open space there were the palaces of the old noblemen. Within the walls, the streets in the past had often been of water, in Venetian style. In the center, those highways were straight, though there were twisted ways beyond the grand heart of the city. To the north of the sacred precinct, outside the walls, the city of Tlatelolco had its own large market and the remains of its pyramid. Perhaps Santa Fe, the artificial city built outside Granada by Fernando and Isabel in 1491, was an inspiration for the new city of Cort�s and Garc�a Bravo, even though it was smaller.</p><h2>The Hidden History of the Human Race: Major Scientific Coverup Exposed</h2><p>&#34; Hidden History is a detective novel as much as a scholarly tour de force.

Here&#x2019;s a culture that has been around for over 4,000 years yet is still struggling to identify itself. An ancient place, and that old-world feel is still there, especially in the areas I visited. I learned that well over 50% of the world&#x2019;s great inventions and innovations originated in China--things like printing, the zero, the compass, the stirrup, the abacus, the seismograph, the rudder, the parachute, and masts and sails. The list is long. But, because of the country&#x2019;s isolation, and the tendency of one emperor to eradicate all vestiges of those who came before him, the Chinese literally forgot what they had accomplished. Can you imagine? <br><br> The country is incredibly varied in geography and culture, it stretches more than 3,000 miles east to west, and it contains two of the world&#x2019;s great deserts, the Gobi and Taklamakan, which I skirted. Some of the highest mountains on the planet rise from the Tibetan plateau in the south, which I visited. Maybe most impressively, 1.3 billion people live in China, so it&#x2019;s the most populous place on the planet. But despite all that, the country remains tremendously fragile, its political culture is volatile and unpredictable, bound together only by force and fear. It would not take much to send it over the edge.</p> <p><b>Question 2: Who was there, on the ground, with you?</b><br><br> Stephanie Nelle, head of the Magellan Billet, authorized the incursion, facilitated by a cooperating Russian agent known only as Ivan. Cassiopeia Vitt accompanied me, along with Viktor Tomas, a freelance agent I&#x2019;d dealt with previously in a file titled <em>The Venetian Betrayal</em>. This time Tomas was covertly working with Karl Tang, China&#x2019;s deputy premier. Cassiopeia and I have not worked together in a while, as my experiences in Germany and the Antarctic last Christmas (detailed in a file titled <em>The Charlemagne Pursuit</em>) and then in France (<em>The Paris Vendetta</em>) did not concern her. Her involvement here came as the result of a long term friendship with a Russian ex-patriot, Lev Sokolov, and the abduction of his son. There&#x2019;s a file, <em>The Balkan Escape</em>, which explains in detail her connection with Sokolov.</p> <p><b>Question 3: Are you able to offer any insight into the epidemic of child trafficking in China?</b><br><br> This is truly a major problem, which Lev Sokolov experienced firsthand.<br><br> Some estimate that as many as 70,000 children are stolen in China every year. Its one-child policy and a cultural preference for boys has fostered a vicious trafficking industry. Sons traditionally care for their parents and, of course, carry on the family name, so female fetuses are many times either aborted or abandoned. Incredibly, it&#x2019;s illegal to abandon, steal, or sell a child in China, but not illegal to buy one. I learned that a young boy costs around $900 U.S. That&#x2019;s a lot of money considering the average Chinese worker earns only about $1,700 U.S. annually. But people pay it. The government is doing something, but not nearly enough to stop it. Lev Sokolov was fighting an uphill battle, and that&#x2019;s why he called Cassiopeia.</p> <p><b>Question 4: What observations, if any, can you offer on Qin Shi&#x2019;s tomb?</b><br><br> The tomb mound itself has stood in central China for over 2,200 years. It was once the size of the pyramid at Giza in Egypt. It took thousands of men over 12 years to complete the underground palace complex where Qin Shi is buried. His body still rests beneath the mound. The tomb itself is the size of a football field, topped by a jeweled ceiling representative of stars and a floor that depicts Qin Shi&#x2019;s empire in three dimensions including mountains, villages, roads, and rivers, lakes, and oceans fashioned of mercury. It has remained unexplored, as no Chinese emperor or government has ever allowed anyone inside. The only written account of the interior was penned 2,000 years ago. A kilometer away stands the terra cotta army--an amazing collection of 8,000 unique soldiers, 130 chariots, and 670 horses, all arrayed in tight battle formation. That area is open to the public and its museum complex is extensively visited. Interestingly, when the terra cotta warriors were discovered in 1974, no one had any idea that they ever existed. Remember that practice of purging memories? The same thing happened here. The emperors who came after Qin Shi made sure that every detail of his existence was forgotten.

Across the ocean, in the leafy suburbs of London, a man caring for his dying wife discovers, among her papers, a lock of hair that unravels a terrible secret. In Jerusalem, an antiques dealer slowly reassembles his father&#x2019;s study, plundered by the Nazis in Budapest in 1944.<br><br> Connecting these stories is a desk of many drawers that exerts a power over those who possess it or have given it away. As the narrators of <em>Great House</em> make their confessions, the desk takes on more and more meaning, and comes finally to stand for all that has been taken from them, and all that binds them to what has disappeared.<br><br><em>Great House</em> is a story haunted by questions: What do we pass on to our children and how do they absorb our dreams and losses? How do we respond to disappearance, destruction, and change?<br><br> Nicole Krauss has written a soaring, powerful novel about memory struggling to create a meaningful permanence in the face of inevitable loss.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: In each of the short stories that nest like rooms in Nicole Krauss's <em>Great House</em> looms a tremendous desk. It may have belonged to Federico Garc�a Lorca, the great poet and dramatist who was one of thousands executed by Fascists in 1936, when the Spanish Civil War began. We know that the desk stood in Weisz's father's study in Budapest on a night in 1944, when the first stone shattered their window. After the war, Weisz hunts furniture looted from Jewish homes by the Nazis. He scours the world for the fragments to reassemble that study's every element, but the desk eludes him, and he and his children live at the edges of its absence. Meanwhile, it spends a few decades in an attic in England, where a woman exhumes the memories she can't speak except through violent stories. She gives the desk to the young Chilean-Jewish poet Daniel Varsky, who takes it to New York and passes it on (before he returns to Chile and disappears under Pinochet) to Nadia, who writes seven novels on it before Varsky's daughter calls to claim it. Crossing decades and continents, the stories of <i>Great House</i> narrate feeling more than fact. Krauss's characters inhabit "a state of perpetual regret and longing for a place we only know existed because we remember a keyhole, a tile, the way the threshold was worn under an open door," and a desk whose multitude of drawers becomes a mausoleum of memory. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em><br> <br>Nicole Krauss has been hailed by the New York Times as "one of America&#x2019;s most important novelists." She is the author of Man Walks Into a Room, a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book of the Year; The History of Love, a New York Times bestseller and winner of the Saroyan Prize for International Literature; Great House, a New York Times bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award; and Forest Dark.

His philosophical questioning, spiritual depth, and brilliantly inventive use of language would be profound influences on poets as diverse as William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane, Elizabeth Bishop, and John Ashbery.<i> The Whole Harmonium</i> presents Stevens within the living context of his times, as well as the creator of a poetry which has had a profound and lasting impact on the modern imagination itself.<br> <br>Stevens established his career as an executive even as he wrote his poetry, becoming a vice president with an insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut. His first and most influential book, <i>Harmonium,</i> was not published until he was forty-four years old. In these poems, Stevens drew on his interest in and understanding of modernism. Over time he became acquainted with the most accomplished of his contemporaries, Robert Frost and William Carlos Williams among them, but his personal style remained unique. He endured an increasingly unhappy marriage, losing himself by writing poetry in his study. Yet he had a witty, comic, and Dionysian side to his personality, including long fishing (and drinking) trips to Florida with his pals and a fascination with the sun-drenched tropics.<br> <br>People generally know two things about Wallace Stevens: that he is a &#x201c;difficult&#x201d; poet and that he was an insurance executive for most of his life. Stevens may be challenging to understand, but he is also greatly rewarding to read. Now, sixty years after Stevens&#x2019;s death, biographer and poet Paul Mariani shows how over the course of his life, Stevens sought out the ineffable and spiritual in human existence in his search for the sublime.</p><p>Paul Mariani is the University Professor of English at Boston College. He is the author of eighteen books, including seven volumes of poetry and biographies of Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Hart Crane, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and William Carlos Williams, which was a National Book Award finalist. His life of Hart Crane, <i>The Broken Tower</i>, was made into a feature-length film directed by and starring James Franco. He lives in western Massachusetts.The Whole Harmonium 7<p></p> The Eye of the Blackbird, 1916&#x2013;1918<p></p> <br>What syllable are you seeking,<br> <br>Vocalissimus,<br> <br>In the distance of sleep?<br> <br>Speak it.<br> <br>&#x201c;TO THE ROARING WIND,&#x201d; 1917<br> <br>On late Saturday afternoon, March 18, 1916, his leather briefcase stuffed with insurance papers from the Hartford, Wallace Stevens, thirty-six, impeccably dressed in a three-piece blue business suit, sits in a Pullman coach alone. He pores over a sheaf of documents and letters of introduction, sipping a martini. It is snowing and it is going to snow over the Pennsylvania hills beyond Reading. He is headed west, and when he wakes tomorrow after a night&#x2019;s twisting and turning in his too-small bunk, he will be in Indiana, where the sun will dazzle and the air will feel positively spring-like. Then he will stop in Chicago and take a brisk walk, gulping in the fresh air along the edge of Lake Michigan before he boards, bound for St. Paul and Minneapolis, where the only two bright signs he will see as he travels through the Wisconsin countryside are billboards advertising Beechnut Bacon and Climax Plug, the Grand Old Chew. Ah, America!<br> <br>When he arrives in St. Paul at ten that evening, he will hail a taxi to take him to the new million-dollar high-rise St. Paul Hotel, where he will take a long, hot bath, ridding himself of the grime from the smoke-belching engines, then get some rest before meeting with his clients at the Hartford&#x2019;s offices at Cushing, Dunn and Driscoll. Then he will be back on the Pullman, this time heading for Minneapolis, where he will stay at another high-rise hotel (with bath) and write Elsie to say he is going to have to be away for yet another week, though it will actually be closer to two before he gets back to New York, so that in the interim she may wish to return to Reading with her mother if her mother tires of New York and wants to go home. He may even call on his uncle Jack, his father&#x2019;s brother here in St. Paul, whom he has not seen in years. But to business first. Water the plants, he reminds her. It is such domestic missives that make up much of his married world now.<br> <br>Returning home through Chicago at the end of March, he takes a room at a top-notch hotel on the Empire Block. It&#x2019;s another new skyscraper near the Chicago Loop, and he invites his aunt Anna, his mother&#x2019;s youngest sister, and her husband, Harry, for a drink in the lobby, and even considers taking them up on their offer to visit, but won&#x2019;t, as there is a portrait of Manet by Fantin-Latour and a superior collection of Renoirs and Monets on loan at the Art Institute in Chicago, plus the old World&#x2019;s Fair grounds and the Lakefront to enjoy.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s also an unexpected telegram from Jim Kearney, his boss, informing Stevens that he will have to stay over in the Windy City for two more days, as there are clients to see and papers to sign. He had hoped to finally meet Harriet Monroe, but that too will have to wait for another time. Then it&#x2019;s back to New York for a few hours before he&#x2019;s on the road once more. And then home again, calling Kreymborg to see how things are going with Others, which&#x2014;like many of the little magazines&#x2014;seems to be in financial trouble. Then it&#x2019;s off on business again, this time heading south. But at least it will be springtime down in the Carolinas, where he will enjoy miles and miles of dogwood and cherry blossoms, while young girls parade about the streets in white for Easter.<br> <br>Six days later it&#x2019;s the twelve-story Mason, its roof-line sign proclaiming that here indeed is the &#x201c;Finest Roof Garden in the South.&#x201d; He dabs his pen into the inkwell in the hotel&#x2019;s library to tell Elsie it&#x2019;s summer here, with hibiscus, acacias, periwinkles, and pansies everywhere and that the trees are already heavy with leaves. Then it&#x2019;s on to Florida. Another week of this, and he and Elsie can finally leave New York behind and head to their apartment in Hartford. In the meantime he takes out a small scrap of cerise paper and writes in that terrible scrawl of his a few lines celebrating the world around him:<br> <br>The lilacs wither in the Carolinas.<br> <br>Already the butterflies flutter above the cabins.<br> <br>Already the new-born children interpret love<br> <br>In the voices of their mothers.<br> <br>Timeless mother,<br> <br>How is it that your aspic nipples<br> <br>For once vent honey?<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>THAT EASTER HE WAS in Biscayne Bay and had to imagine the parade making its way along New York&#x2019;s Fifth Avenue, even as in the park a church choir was singing, much like the one he remembered in Reading. Was there anything &#x201c;more inane than an Easter carol,&#x201d; which, when he thought about it, was nothing more than &#x201c;a religious perversion of the activity of Spring in our blood&#x201d;? Why a man who would prefer &#x201c;to roll around in the grass should be asked to dress as magnificently as possible and listen to a choir&#x201d; was a mystery to him, &#x201c;except from the flagellant point of view,&#x201d; he told Elsie.<br> <br>The truth was that the theater of his mind seemed to dwell in a place more like hell these days. And that theater, like the theater of the war raging across the Atlantic, constituted a world of darkness and oscillating shadows, upon which a raw red sun revealed things as they were. Earlier he&#x2019;d written a one-act play called Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise and sent it to Poetry, and had just learned that it had been chosen from among some eighty plays to win a prize of $100 and publication in the July issue. What he had tried to do with his play, he told Monroe, was &#x201c;create a poetic atmosphere with a minimum of narration.&#x201d; It was the first thing like it he&#x2019;d ever done, and he was &#x201c;delighted with the result.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All you need, / To find poetry,&#x201d; one of the Chinese characters in the play says in the opening lines, &#x201c;is to look for it with a lantern.&#x201d; But by the play&#x2019;s close, the scholar of one candle has been replaced by another, who sees that the very sunrise is not one thing, but as many things as there are observers. Stevens wasn&#x2019;t interested in a plot and character development, he told Monroe, for here&#x2014;as in his poems&#x2014;narrative and character development were at most secondary. The real point of the play came in the final sentence of the final speech, where reality was revealed as &#x201c;many-faceted as the leaves of a forest reddened by first light.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the June issue of Poetry, Monroe would go so far as to define Stevens&#x2019;s play as a &#x201c;formative moment in our poetic drama,&#x201d; which Stevens felt was over the top. The play, he told Monroe&#x2019;s associate, Alice Corbin, was something &#x201c;quite out of the question in the ordinary theatre.&#x201d; Still, he did think &#x201c;that in the hands of people of imagination and feeling, it might do very well.&#x201d; He wanted to see it performed, but only if it were done &#x201c;properly and sensitively,&#x201d; though, in a practical sense, that would have to be left to those footing the bill.<br> <br>Four years later, on Friday evening, February 13, 1920, the play would have its sole performance at the Provincetown Playhouse on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. But by then its six characters would search in vain for their author, for, while Stevens was in New York that day, he did not go to see his play performed. &#x201c;So much water has gone under the bridges since the thing was written,&#x201d; he told Monroe, &#x201c;that I have not the curiosity even to read it at this late day,&#x201d; and that was the &#x201c;truth, not pose.&#x201d; Thirty-five years after he&#x2019;d written the play, he told a composer interested in turning it into a musical composition that he&#x2019;d long since given up writing plays because he cared much more for the elegiac than he did the dramatic.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>BY LATE MAY 1916 he and Elsie were settled in Hartford at the Highland Court Hotel at 38-40 Windsor Avenue, two and a half miles north of Stevens&#x2019;s office on Trumbull Street. The Highland was a five-story brick building with 250 apartments, sported a dining room, lobby, parlor, kitchen, barber shop, and servants&#x2019; quarters, and advertized itself as &#x201c;an Hotel for Homelovers with the Atmosphere of an English Inn and the Convenience and Comfort of an American Home of the Best Class.&#x201d; For years to come Elsie would have to live alone in Hartford much as she had in Manhattan while her husband traveled. Still, Hartford for her was infinitely better than New York. Just a week into their stay at the Highland, Stevens wrote Ferdinand Reyher that he already missed New York &#x201c;abominably,&#x201d; though &#x201c;Mrs. Stevens, with murderous indifference, pretends that Hartford is sweet to her spirit.&#x201d;<br> <br>By then Williams was editing Others in Rutherford and writing Stevens about a batch of poems Stevens had sent him earlier. Among them was a draft of Stevens&#x2019;s unfinished &#x201c;For an Old Woman in a Wig,&#x201d; written in rhymed terza rima, no doubt as a nod to Walter Arensberg, who had been translating the Divine Comedy. Many of Stevens&#x2019;s three-line stanzas still had gaps in them, and the rhyming remained for the most part plodding, but he did manage to catch something of Dante&#x2019;s masculine clarity and authority. The fragment was mostly scrawled in pencil with many erasures, and Stevens would soon abandon the form while he worked and reworked the ideas contained therein for decades to come. For his part, Williams liked the final lines especially, he told Stevens, because there he&#x2019;d allowed himself to &#x201c;become fervent for a moment.&#x201d; Forget the epic poetry of sky and sea, Stevens had written there. Better to push into the &#x201c;unknown new&#x201d; all around one and see what might be discovered there. The poem of the present, then: there was a worthwhile project.<br> <br>A week later Williams wrote Stevens again, congratulating him &#x201c;on winning &#x2019;ARRIET&#x2019;S prize!&#x201d; for Three Travelers. He was keeping a copy of Stevens&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Worms at Heaven&#x2019;s Gate&#x201d; for the July issue of Others because it was &#x201c;a splendid poem,&#x201d; though &#x201c;a change or two&#x201d; would &#x201c;strengthen the poem materially.&#x201d; The first edit was to change the second line from &#x201c;Within our bellies, as a chariot&#x201d; to &#x201c;Within our bellies, we her chariot.&#x201d; Williams wanted the change because &#x201c;THE WORMS ARE HER CHARIOT AND NOT ONLY SEEM HER CHARIOT,&#x201d; he wrote in bold caps. &#x201c; &#x2018;We her chariot&#x2019; has more of a collective sense and feels more solid.&#x201d; Then he added, &#x201c;What do you say?&#x201d; He also urged Stevens to remove two lines from another poem which he thought too sentimental. &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;yield to me and become great and famous,&#x201d; which was what Stevens did.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Worms at Heaven&#x2019;s Gate&#x201d; is a dark poem. Macabre, really, dealing as it does with the fleetingness of a woman&#x2019;s beauty, even the beauty of a Badroulbadour lifted from the pages of Arabian Nights, reputedly the most beautiful woman in the world. It was not the lark at heaven&#x2019;s gate this time round, as Shakespeare had it, but worms lifting the body piecemeal toward the empty heavens. Nine lines, with the last line, following a long silence, returning the reader to the opening, with a new ring of horror:<br> <br>Out of the tomb, we bring Badroulbadour,<br> <br>Within our bellies, we her chariot.<br> <br>Here is an eye. And here are, one by one,<br> <br>The lashes of that eye and its white lid.<br> <br>Here is the cheek on which that lid declined,<br> <br>And, finger after finger, here, the hand,<br> <br>The genius of that cheek. Here are the lips,<br> <br>The bundle of the body and the feet.<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Out of the tomb we bring Badroulbadour.<br> <br>From St. Paul that June, Stevens wrote Elsie that nobody seemed to recognize him for the &#x201c;Eminent Vers Libriste&#x201d; he was. In a parody of a newspaper report, he wrote that &#x201c;Wallace Stevens, the playwright and barrister,&#x201d; had &#x201c;arrived at Union Station, at 10:30 o&#x2019;clock this morning,&#x201d; where &#x201c;some thirty representatives were not present to greet him.&#x201d; When &#x201c;asked how he liked St. Paul, Mr. Stevens, borrowing a cigar, said, &#x2018;I like it.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Just now the news was all about General &#x201c;Black Jack&#x201d; Pershing leading a large expeditionary force into Mexico in an attempt&#x2014;unsuccessful, as it turned out&#x2014;to capture Pancho Villa. Stevens was impressed with the squads of recruits&#x2014;husky, virile young men&#x2014;drilling in the square opposite the Minnesota Club, where he was staying. But he was not impressed with President Wilson&#x2019;s handling of the situation, feeling he&#x2019;d made a serious mistake in sending American troops into Mexico without first declaring war. But then, he added, staunch Republican that he was, Wilson, a Democrat, had &#x201c;an unfortunate ease&#x201d; in getting the country into messes. &#x201c;Why all this horror of what must be done,&#x201d; he wondered. After all, a good fight might be just the thing to settle the matter.<br> <br>One evening, returning to the Club after work, he happened to pass his uncle Jim on the street, but instead of stopping to say hello, he just kept walking. &#x201c;It was very nice to see him and not to be recognized,&#x201d; he wrote Elsie. After all, what was there to say? Family relations were stupid, and he was sure that, after asking each other a few questions, &#x201c;there&#x2019;d be nothing in the world to talk about except Japan,&#x201d; and he felt no need to talk about Japan. Three years later the scene would be repeated when Stevens was in Cleveland, where his brother Garrett was now practicing law. One afternoon he spotted his brother on the street, but&#x2014;having nothing to say&#x2014;crossed the street and just kept walking.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS ON THE other hand did matter, and Jim Kearney certainly looked upon Stevens as a valued asset. It was Kearney who saw to it that the Stevenses had comfortable housing when they moved that summer from their hotel to Farmington, a fifteen-minute trolley ride along tree-shaded Farmington Avenue. Then, in late August, they were able to move to 594 Prospect Avenue, an extensive three-story dark brick apartment building on the corner of Farmington Avenue, two miles from Stevens&#x2019;s office, so that he could get in his daily exercise, breathing in the Connecticut air as he walked briskly to and from work.<br> <br>At first he and Elsie hobnobbed with the best of Hartford&#x2019;s society, though in time, given Elsie&#x2019;s awkward shyness, they would isolate themselves more and more. But on January 26, 1917, with Elsie in Reading caring for her sick mother, Stevens attended a dinner at the Heubleins&#x2019;, an extremely successful German American family who had made a fortune with their A-1 Steak Sauce and then with ready-made bottled cocktails and later would make millions with Smirnoff&#x2019;s vodka, the &#x201c;new white whiskey.&#x201d; That evening turned out to be &#x201c;a regular blowout,&#x201d; with everybody, Stevens wrote, &#x201c;dressed like a warlord&#x201d; except himself, who looked more like that image of Ben Franklin one found on boxes of Quaker Oats. Among those he&#x2019;d met was the Viennese Wagnerian soprano Melanie Kurt, &#x201c;one of the best singers at the Metropolitan Opera,&#x201d; whose career would be cut short just months later when the United States, after declaring war on Germany, forbade Wagner&#x2019;s operas from being performed.<br> <br>In February Stevens traveled with Kearney to Omaha on business, and when that project had to be aborted, the two returned to Minneapolis, where Stevens headed south to Houston by himself. There were high winds and snow throughout Minnesota, so that Stevens&#x2019;s train was delayed twelve hours. E...</p><h2>Modern Classics Orlando a Biography (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Once described as the &#39;longest and most charming love-letter in literature&#39;, the Virginia Woolf&#39;s Orlando is edited by Brenda Lyons with an introduction and notes by Sandra M. Gilbert in Penguin Classics. Written for Virginia Woolf&#39;s intimate friend, the charismatic writer Vita Sackville-West, Orlando is a playful mock &#39;biography&#39; of a chameleonic historical figure, immortal and ageless, who changes sex and identity on a whim. First masculine, then feminine, Orlando begins life as a young sixteenth-century nobleman, then gallops through three centuries to end up as a woman writer in Virginia Woolf&#39;s own time. A wry commentary on gender roles and modes of history, Orlando is also, in Woolf&#39;s own words, a light-hearted &#39;writer&#39;s holiday&#39; which delights in ambiguity and capriciousness. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of &#39;The Bloomsbury Group&#39;. This informal collective of artists and writers, which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway (1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves (1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando (1928) and A Room of One&#39;s Own (1929) a passionate feminist essay. If you enjoyed Orlando, you might like Woolf&#39;s The Waves, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;I read this book and believed it was a hallucinogenic, interactive biography of my own life and future&#39; Tilda Swinton</p><p>In 1928, way before everyone else was talking about gender-bending and way, way before the terrific movie with Tilda Swinton, Virginia Woolf wrote her comic masterpiece, a fantastic, fanciful love letter disguised as a biography, to Vita Sackville-West. Orlando enters the book as an Elizabethan nobleman and leaves the book three centuries and one change of gender later as a liberated woman of the 1920s. Along the way this most rambunctious of Woolf&#39;s characters engages in sword fights, trades barbs with 18th century wits, has a baby, and drives a car. This is a deliriously written, breathless-making book and a classic both of lesbian literature and the Western canon.Introduction by Quentin Bell <br> <br>Originally conceived by Virginia Woolf as a playful tribute to Vita Sackville-West, the central character lives as both a man and a woman through four centuries. This definitive edition contains the original Hogarth Press text as overseen by the author, the illustrations which appeared in the first edition in 1928 and a list of textual variants that appeared during her lifetime.</p><h2>Les Liaisons Dangereuses (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>An epistolary novel chronicles the cruel seduction of a young girl by two ruthless, eighteenth-century aristocrats</p><p>Douglas Parmee is Retired Fellow of Queen&#39;s College, Cambridge.

The healer, Juniper, and her apprentice, Wise Child, are accused of witchcraft and forced to flee their small town. Wise Child&#x2019;s devoted cousin, Colman, escapes with them. This is his story of their arrival to the land of Juniper&#x2019;s birth, where she is, in fact, a princess.</p><p>Known in her homeland of England in many roles&#x2014;journalist, biographer, novelist, feminist, and activist&#x2014;Monica Furlong was best known in the United States for her award-winning novels, <i>Juniper</i> and <i>Wise Child</i>. Monica Furlong died of cancer in January 2003 at the age of 72. <i>Colman</i> is her last work.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Four of us escaped on Finbar's ship after Juniper's trial as a witch&#x2014;Juniper, Wise Child, Cormac, and me. There had been so much fear for all of us except Finbar, a terrible walk across the island for Juniper and Wise Child, and then suddenly we were all sailing across a peaceful sea, safe at last. It was only a few weeks since Juniper had lived at the white house, had taken care of my cousin Wise Child, and had helped the people of the village with remedies for their sicknesses and accidents. Then came the accusation of black magic, with the sequel of torture and possible death, and Juniper, who had been arrested and imprisoned, had only just escaped in time.<br><br>And now there the five of us were on the ship, along with Finbar's men. It was a beautiful evening. Juniper and Wise Child sat in the stern of the boat watching the sunset and recovering from their ordeal, Wise Child small and dark, Juniper with her arm around her. Juniper's long black hair blew wildly about until she put her shawl over it to tame it. Cormac stood staring over the stern with his scarred, damaged face, seeing the island grow smaller and smaller. I guess he had few regrets for the place where he had known great unhappiness. Me, although I felt bad about leaving Mam and my brothers and sisters without saying goodbye, I was very glad to get away from Dad and his belt and to have started an adventure with the people I loved best, not counting my family.<br><br>It was terribly exciting to be on a ship like Finbar's. It had sails, something I had never seen before. The. island boats were small and light and made out of wicker and hide, whereas Finbar's boat, like the <i>birlinns</i> on which I had very occasionally traveled to the mainland with my father, was made out of wood. And now, with the wind behind us, we had begun to move rapidly and would sail for distances I had barely dreamed of. Already we had passed islands of which I did not even know the names.<br><br>I followed Finbar about, listening to him giving orders and imagining myself as captain of a ship. Soon Finbar suggested chores I could do like a proper sailor. One of the men showed me how to coil a rope, and Cully, the ship's cook, got me peeling vegetables in the galley.<br><br>That first night was a joyful one. Finbar broached some wine, and even Wise Child and I were given a generous amount with a splash of water. It was too soon to start asking any of the difficult questions about where we would go and what we would do. We were all just glad to be together and to be safe.<br><br>I did notice that Wise Child seemed a little shy of Finbar. Although he was her dad, he had been at sea for several years, and she had looked forward to his return for so long. I think she was surprised to find that he seemed like a stranger to her. Perhaps his sheer size was intimidating. Finbar was a very tall man with a beard and strong, handsome features. He had black hair and brilliant blue eyes, just like her own, along with wonderful pale skin.<br><br>We enjoyed our feast&#x2014;we were all really hungry&#x2014;and then Finbar found beds for all of us. He turned out of his bunk and put Juniper in it. Wise Child he put in a little made-up bed on the floor. He slung hammocks for himself and for Cormac and me on the deck. I did not go to sleep for hours&#x2014;it seemed a pity to waste my excitement in sleep. I loved watching the movement of the stars overhead and feeling the gentle movement of the ship.<br><br>I fell asleep at last and slept well, but was awakened in the early morning by shouting. A strong wind was blowing, and the sea had become much rougher. The sailors were clambering up the mast and along the yardarm, pulling in sails and tying them into place.<br><br>I hastily did up my trousers and folded my hammock, wanting to be part of it all. We were passing through a channel with land on both sides.<br><br>"That's Ireland!" one of the sailors shouted to me, pointing to starboard. "They call this the North Channel!"<br><br>Before I could offer my services as a sailor, Finbar ordered me down to the galley. Cully was already at work gutting some fish, and I helped him clean up afterward.<br><br>"Fancy a bit of bacon, boy?" he asked when we had finished.<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>"The sea hasn't put you off your breakfast, then?"<br><br>I thought about it. No, my stomach felt fine.<br><br>"I'd like your help. There's a lot to do on a ship on a morning like this, and it's important not to get in the men's way.&#x201d;<br><br>It occurred to me later that Finbar had asked him to tell me this in a way that did not hurt my feelings.<br><br>"Have you washed?" he then surprised me by asking.<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>"Must keep clean on a ship, &#x2019;specially when you're a cook." He nodded to a flagon of water in the corner with a cloth beside it, and under his eye I washed my face and hands. I had not realized sailors were so fussy. Then I started chopping onions until the tears ran down my face. I had just started on a mound of cabbage when a sailor appeared at the door.<br><br>"Cap'n sends his compliments and would like to talk to you, sir," he said to me. "He's at the wheel."<br><br>I was so overcome at being called "sir" that I just mumbled, "All right," but Cully prompted me quietly: "Aye, aye." I duly echoed him, then followed the sailor above deck.<br><br>Finbar made a fine figure at the wheel and for a few moments did not speak to me. Finbar, I was to learn, was a man of long silences.<br><br>"We're having a council of war tonight, Colman," he said at last. "All of us, to decide where to go, what to do. But I wanted to talk to you first.<br><br>"It seems bad luck that you have got caught up in all this and dragged away from your family. I dare not let you go back, however. They would certainly suspect you were involved in the escape because of your friendship with Wise Child. "<br><br>I nodded. If I went back, there would be endless questions, and my dad would do his best to beat the truth out of me. I was much more frightened of him than I was of Cormac's brother, Fillan, the priest who, during the time of famine and the smallpox epidemic, had roused the people against Juniper. There was little hardship for me in going on a voyage with my favorite people.<br><br>The effort of explaining all this felt too great. I grinned instead and said, "I don't mind!"<br><br>Finbar looked at me in a searching way with eyes that were so much like Wise Child's. Then he shook his head slightly and laughed. "So be it!"<br><br>It was not till I saw Wise Child and Juniper in Finbar's cabin that evening that I realized that though they had escaped, the ordeal was not over for them. The previous night they had seemed calm, serene. Tonight, however, Juniper looked pale and drawn, entirely unlike her usual rosy self. There were shadows under her eyes, and she kept propping up her head with her hand as if she was too exhausted to hold it upright.</p><h2>Moonstone</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

By the time Roosevelt found out about this a month later, the foundations for the Pentagon had already been put in place."[Brinkley] is an excellent raconteur, and his book--a combination of memoir and popular history--consists of an amiable, extraordinarily readable anecdotal narrative, running from the late 1930s through V-J Day."--Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times Book World<br><br>"Astonishing. . .

A string of disturbing cases has put her vacation plans on hold; instead, she heads to the lab to analyze charred remains from a suspicious fire, and a mysterious black residue from a small plane crash. But most troubling of all are the bones. . . . Tempe's daughter's new boyfriend invites them to a picnic -- a pig pickin' -- in the North Carolina countryside, where a cache of bones turns up. But are they animal or human? X-rays and DNA may link the crimes, but they can't reveal who is closing in on Tempe and her daughter -- and how far they will go to keep her from uncovering the truth.</p><p><blockquote> "As I was packaging what remained of the dead baby, the man I would kill was burning pavement north toward Charlotte." </blockquote><p> With this opening sentence, Kathy Reichs serves notice that her heroine, Temperance Brennan, is in for one of her scariest, most gruesome adventures yet. As fans of this popular series already know, Tempe is a forensic anthropologist: an expert in the human form (especially bones) who helps solve crimes. The abovementioned infant is only the first in a series of grisly remains, both human and animal, that Tempe must sort through and decode. Meanwhile, as several seemingly unrelated cases begin to intertwine, her sleuthing puts her in the crosshairs of a very nasty stalker who hides behind an e-mail alias.</p><p> Reichs knows how to keep the narrative ball rolling with a canny mix of plot developments, character delineation, and scientific detail, all relayed in Tempe's smart, breezy, sarcastic voice. In fact, <i>Bare Bones</i> has a few <i>too</i> many characters and plot lines for Reichs--or most readers--to keep perfect track of. But it's a fun ride anyway, enlivened by some steamy romantic scenes and some fascinating, appalling information about the illicit trade in endangered wildlife (did you know that bears' gall bladders fetch more money per ounce than cocaine?). <i>Bare Bones</i> is a crisp, enjoyable read that cements Kathy Reichs's standing as the best forensic-thriller writer at work today. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>Kathy Reichs&#x2019;s first novel&nbsp;<i>D�j� Dead</i>&nbsp;was a #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller and won the 1997 Ellis Award for Best First Novel.&nbsp;<i>A Conspiracy of Bones</i>&nbsp;is Kathy&#x2019;s nineteenth entry in her series featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.

Consisting of three xeroxed sheets of paper, and with a print run of twenty-five, it was a less-than-auspicious, largely unnoticed debut.

Sociologist Rodney Stark surveys the birth and growth of religions around the world&#x2014;from the prehistoric era of primal beliefs; the history of the pyramids found in Iraq, Egypt, Mexico, and Cambodia; and the great "Axial Age" of Plato, Zoroaster, Confucius, and the Buddha, to the modern Christian missions and the global spread of Islam. He argues for a free-market theory of religion and for the controversial thesis that under the best, unimpeded conditions, the true, most authentic religions will survive and thrive. Among his many conclusions:</p><ul><p></p><li>Despite decades of faulty reports that early religions were crude muddles of superstition, it turns out that primitive humans had surprisingly sophisticated notions about God and Creation.</li><p></p><p></p><li>The idea of "sin" appeared suddenly in the sixth century BCE and quickly reshaped religious ideas from Europe to China.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Some major world religions seem to lack any plausible traces of divine inspiration.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Ironically, some famous figures who attempted to found "Godless" religions ended up being worshiped as Gods.</li><p></p></ul><p>Most people believe in the existence of God (or Gods), and this has apparently been so throughout human history. Many modern biologists and psychologists reject these spiritual ideas, especially those about the existence of God, as delusional. They claim that religion is a primitive survival mechanism that should have been discarded as humans evolved beyond the stage where belief in God served any useful purpose&#x2014;that in modern societies, faith is a misleading crutch and an impediment to reason. In <em>Discovering God</em>, award-winning sociologist Rodney Stark responds to this position, arguing that it is our capacity to understand God that has evolved&#x2014;that humans now know much more about God than they did in ancient times.</p></p><p><p>Rodney Stark is the Distinguished Professor of the Social Sciences at Baylor University. His thirty books on the history and sociology of religion include <em>The Rise of Christianity</em>, <em>Cities of God</em>, <em>For the Glory of God</em>, <em>Discovering God</em>, and <em>The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success</em>. Stark received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>*Starred Review* Skeptics such as Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett have just lost their monopoly on the topic of religious evolution. Only a believer, Stark asserts, can fathom the origins and subsequent unfolding of the world's great faiths. In this wide-ranging investigation, Stark detects sacred reality&#x2014;not pious deception&#x2014;at the heart of transcendent beliefs shared by Aborigines and Anglicans. In their myths of the high gods, Stark contends, early tribal peoples glimpsed divine truths obscured in later civilizations when pharaohs and emperors lent government support to temple priesthoods more interested in maintaining a comfortable lifestyle than in serving God. The eventual emergence of a religious marketplace in ancient Rome opened a wide range of metaphysical options. Yet in a culture of religious pluralism, the insistent claims of tightly knit communities of Jews and Christians appeared threatening to Roman leaders, who defended the status quo by persecuting adherents to these unsettlingly intense faiths. Yet it is in these revelatory faiths&#x2014;and not the meditative religions of Eastern Asia&#x2014;that Stark discerns the fullest manifestation of God. Some readers will resist Stark's comparative judgments; others will dispute his religious interpretation of modern science. But serious students of religion will recognize this as an essential sourcebook.

One night she receives a text from an anonymous number that says, &#x201c;<i>U R my MILF</i>!&#x201d; Over the months that follow, that message comes to obsess Eve. While leading her all-too-placid life&#x2014;serving as Executive Director of the local senior center and taking a community college course on Gender and Society&#x2014;Eve can&#x2019;t curtail her own interest in a porn website that features the erotic exploits of ordinary, middle-aged women like herself. Before long, Eve&#x2019;s online fixations begin to spill over into real life, revealing new romantic possibilities that threaten to upend her quiet suburban existence.<br> <br>Meanwhile, miles away at the state college, Eve&#x2019;s son Brendan&#x2014;a jock and aspiring frat boy&#x2014;discovers that his new campus isn&#x2019;t nearly as welcoming to his hard-partying lifestyle as he had imagined. Only a few weeks into his freshman year, Brendan is floundering in a college environment that challenges his white-dude privilege and shames him for his outmoded, chauvinistic ideas of sex. As the New England autumn turns cold, both mother and son find themselves enmeshed in morally fraught situations that come to a head on one fateful November night.<br> <br>&#x201c;The sweetest and most charming novel about pornography addiction and the harrowing issues of sexual consent that you will probably ever read&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>),<i> Mrs. Fletcher </i>is a timeless examination of sexuality, identity, parenthood, and the big clarifying mistakes people can make when they&#x2019;re no longer sure of who they are or where they belong. &#x201c;Tom Perrotta&#x2019;s latest might just be his best&#x201d; (NPR).</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2017:</strong> Tom Perrotta&#x2019;s latest is about a recent empty nester, struggling with this alien status and desperate for a distraction, when a very saucy one is served-up anonymously on her phone. No, it's not a message from Anthony Weiner, but it is something that piques Mrs. Fletcher's interest to such a degree that she becomes obsessed with a certain "adult site" and suddenly her sleepy suburban existence is sleepy no more. Meanwhile her son, whose clueless moments of Neanderthalism are proving a liability with the college ladies, is trying to find his footing in life too. Right off the bat you know that <em>Mrs. Fletcher</em> is going to veer into awkward territory, and it does have its cringe-worthy moments (which I think Perrotta inflicts with glee). But these characters are so expertly drawn that it&#x2019;s easy to relate to, and sympathize with, their bumbling attempts at working through existential crises (unintentionally hilarious, and even shocking these efforts may be). The secondary characters are just as strong, and refreshingly unexpected. When Mrs. Fletcher&#x2019;s ex-husband is introduced, you find out that he left her for a younger model he courted on Craigslist, and you think...Of course! But he&#x2019;s actually not what you think at all, nor is his new wife. These are ordinary people making life-changing mistakes at a time when they should be (mostly) grown up. That&#x2019;s the thing, though--no matter where we are in life--we always have growing to do...Perrotta, ever the provocateur, ties up a narrative loose end by creating yet another in the end. It&#x2019;s something that will needle at you, in an uncomfortably good way. Such is <em>Mrs. Fletcher</em>. <em>--Erin Kodicek, Amazon Book Review</em>Tom Perrotta is the bestselling author of eight works of fiction, including&nbsp;<i>Election</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Little Children</i>, both of which were made into critically acclaimed movies, and&nbsp;<i>The Leftovers</i>, which was adapted into an HBO series.

For three days, a team of scientists is a U.S. government laboratory has been frantically trying to unlock the virus's secrets. When the leading researcher from that lab, Lt. Col. Jonathan Smith, returns from overseas, he barely survives a series of well-orchestrated attempts made on his life. By the time Smith eludes his pursuers and makes it home, he discovers that the virus has claimed its fourth victim, Dr. Sophia Russell--Smith's fiancee. Devastated and enraged, Smith quickly uncovers evidence that his lover's death was no accident--that someone out there has the virus, and the pandemic that threatens hundreds of millions of lives is no accident. But wherever he turns, Smith finds that some unseen force has blocked his quest for information.<br><br>Not knowing whom to trust, Smith assembles a private team to search for the truth behind the deadly virus. While the death toll mounts, their quest leads to the highest levels of power and the darkest corners of the earth, as they match wits with a determined genius--and as the fate of the world lies in the balance.<br><br></p><p>With an unbroken string of bestsellers dating from the early '70s (beginning with 1971's <i>The Scarlatti Inheritance</i>) and over 200 million books sold, Robert Ludlum is an acknowledged superstar of the political thriller. Gayle Lynds, who was compared to Ludlum after her 1996 debut, <i>Masquerade</i>, has two successful novels and a slew of pseudonymous pulp fiction titles to her credit. Together--after a fashion--they serve up book 1 of Ludlum's new Covert-One series of trade paperback originals, <i>Robert Ludlum's the Hades Factor</i>.<p> After three disparate Americans succumb to a hitherto unknown Ebola-like virus, the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) is pressed into service. Since the USAMRIID's top doc (and former military intelligence operative) Lt. Col. Jon Smith has yet to return from an overseas conference, the job of heading the medical research team falls to Smith's colleague and fianc�e, Dr. Sophia Russell.</p><p> Upon Smith's return, he is sequentially treated to a life-or-death warning from a childhood friend (and rogue FBI agent), several nasty near-death experiences, and the viscerally graphic demise of his wife-to-be, an apparent virus victim. Enraged and bereaved, Smith flies into investigatory action only to discover doctored files, expunged records, and the distinct likelihood that he's dealing with cases of murder-by-virus. As more questions are asked, more deaths occur, official channels slam shut, and Smith finds himself a wanted man, battling his best friend, an evil-genius gazillionaire scientist, corrupt politicians, and Third World terrorists. In other words, it's Smith versus all the usual suspects.</p><p> Ludlum and Lynds cover no new ground here (and their prose is less than sterling). In fact, <i>The Hades Factor</i> owes as much to Tom Clancy's Op-Center series--cocreated by Clancy and Steve Pieczenik--and Richard Preston's <i>The Hot Zone</i> as it does to Ludlum's own considerable body of work. That said, <i>The Hades Factor</i> still delivers a respectable level of intrigue and suspense, will likely be snapped up by output-starved Ludlum fanciers, and will be right at home on the bed stands of Preston fans. <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p>Robert Ludlum is the unchallenged master of suspense and global intrigue. For more than thirty years, his many books have thrilled hundreds of millions of readers. Each one of his books has reached the top of bestseller lists the world over and has set a standard that's yet to be equaled. Now, from the imagination of one of America's greatest storytellers, comes Covert-One--a bold new series of international thrillers that deliver the complex, compelling action and heart-stopping suspense for which Robert Ludlum has become so justly famous. <p></p></p><h2>Savannah or A Gift For Mr Lincoln</h2><p>As Sherman and his army march from Atlanta to the sea in 1864, the charming old city of Savannah lies directly in their path, threatening the livelihood of widow Sara Lester and her twelve-year-old daughter Hattie, who struggle to save the family plantation, but when Sherman offers Lincoln the city as a Christmas gift, he finds himself on a collision course with young Hattie. 225,000 first printing.</p><p>John Jakes is the author of sixteen consecutive <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. His most recent work, <i>Charleston</i>, was his top-selling hardcover novel of the last ten years and appeared on bestseller lists coast to coast.The Christmas of 1864 wasn't a merry one in Savannah, as the Union forces took control of the Confederate city. Tensions simmered between the Union forces and the defiant Southerners. Against this backdrop, widowed Sara Lester and her 12-year-old daughter, Hattie, take refuge in a friend's Savannah home, only to have a rough encounter with rogue Union foragers. The incident angers young Hattie and offends the Union occupiers, leading the girl to a confrontation with William Tecumseh Sherman. Dylan Baker, who knows his way around a Southern accent, puts a bit of exaggeration in his accents and characterizations to highlight the human comedy in this wartime conflict. His approach helps reveal the central characters in both the harsh light of a tense situation and, later, in the softer, warmer glow befitting a holiday season.

At times, he has also taken in orphaned infants&#x2015;feeding them, walking them through the forest for months to help them decipher their natural world, and eventually reintroducing them back into the wild. Once free, the orphaned bears still regard him as their mother. And one of these bears, now a 17-year-old female, has given him extraordinary access to her daily life, opening a rare window into how she and the wild bears she lives among carry out their daily lives, raise their young, and communicate.</p> <p>Witnessing this world has led to some remarkable discoveries.&nbsp; For years, scientists have considered black bears to be mostly solitary.&nbsp; Kilham's observations, though, reveal the extraordinary interactions wild bears have with each other. They form friendships and alliances; abide by a code of conduct that keeps their world orderly; and when their own food supplies are ample, they even help out other bears in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Could these cooperative behaviors, he asks, mimic behavior that existed in the animal that became human?&nbsp; In watching bears, do we see our earliest forms of communications unfold?&nbsp;</p> <p>Kilham's dyslexia once barred him from getting an advanced academic degree, securing funding for his research, and publishing his observations in the scientific literature. After being shunned by the traditional scientific community, though, Kilham&#x2019;s unique findings now interest bear researchers worldwide. His techniques even aid scientists working with pandas in China and bears in Russia.</p> <p>Moreover, the observation skills that fueled Kilham&#x2019;s exceptional work turned out to be born of his dyslexia. His ability to think in pictures and decipher systems makes him a unique interpreter of the bear's world.</p> <p><em>Out on a Limb</em>&nbsp;delivers Kilham&#x2019;s fascinating glimpse at the inner world of bears, and also makes a passionate case for science, and education in general, to open its doors to different ways of learning and researching&#x2015;doors that could lead to far broader realms of discovery.</p> <p>Kilham and his work have been featured in five internationally televised documentaries. In addition to being on over forty nationally broadcast radio shows including National Public Radio, he has appeared on&nbsp;<em>The Today Show</em>,&nbsp;<em>Good Morning America</em>,&nbsp;<em>ABC Nightly News</em>,&nbsp;<em>The David Letterman Show</em>, and more.</p></p><p><p>Ben Kilham has been researching and living with black bears for nearly twenty years. He has become an expert in black bear behavior, as well as in rehabilitating orphaned and injured bears and reintroducing them to the wild.&nbsp; He is invited to lecture all over the United States and internationally.&nbsp; His previous book is <em>Among the Bears, Raising Orphan Cubs in the Wild&nbsp;</em> Kilham and his work with black bears have been featured in five internationally televised documentaries, including National Geographic and Discovery Channel features, and he has appeared on <em>The Today Show, Good Morning America, ABC Nightly News, ABC Nightly News International, The O&#x2019;Reilly Factor, Fox News Daytime Edition, Inside Edition, The David Letterman Show, NBC Nightline, CBS Coast to Coast, Canadian Broadcasting Company Nightly News</em>, and various other shows, as well as National Public Radio, and a host of nationally broadcast radio shows. He lives in Lyme, New Hampshire.</p><p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em></p> <p>"Animal behaviorists like Kilham (<em>Among the Bears</em>) are at a disadvantage in the world of science: they observe their animals in nature rather than in the lab. Severely dyslexic, Kilham was denied admission to a doctoral program: that, too, made his work suspect. But he&#x2019;s raised 27 orphan bears from infancy and been friends to one bear for 14 years now. Kilham even discovered a sensory organ in black bears that helps them to determine which plants are safe to eat. In straightforward prose, Kilham sets forth what he&#x2019;s learned from more than 20 years of working with bears. They aren&#x2019;t loners, as thought, but inhabit a complicated world of reciprocal social arrangements that allow them to browse other bears&#x2019; territories when food is scarce in their own. They read mood and intent and discipline bears that transgress. Kilham speculates on the relevance of his observations to early human development and sees bears&#x2019; behavior as a possible analog to ours.&nbsp; VERDICT Anyone who enjoys reading works by Temple Grandin (who provides the foreword here), Jane Goodall, or Frans de Waal will enjoy this book. Kilham is a worthy member of a small but increasingly vocal confraternity of scientists who watch as often as they count."</p><br><br><p>"Magnificent! <em>Out on a Limb</em> is a brilliant read. Kilham perfectly exemplifies how much the world has to gain from the exceptional insights of dyslexic individuals, who often possess a special talent for finding order hidden in the complex patterns of the real world. We cannot recommend this book highly enough."<strong>--Brock and Fernette Eide, authors of <em>The Dyslexic Advantage</em>&nbsp; </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>"Kilham's latest is the most thought-provoking book that I've read about bears. It not only made me think differently about black bears, it also enriched how I feel about them."<strong>--Stephen Herrero, biologist and author of <em>Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"No one knows black bears like Ben Kilham does. During the past decade alone he has raised and rehabilitated to the wild more than 100 orphaned cubs. The social code of the bears, as so delightfully described in <em>Out on a Limb</em>, includes cooperation, imitation, fairness, punishment for infraction, reciprocity, and other traits of this solitary yet highly social species. Human parallels are drawn, too. The charm and core of the book lie in its anecdotes and unique insights, especially of the female Squirty with whom Ben has had a friendship for more than seventeen years. Read this fascinating book and see the bear's world with new eyes."<strong>--George Schaller, author of <em>The Last Panda</em>; science director, Wildlife Conservation Society</strong></p><br><br><p>"<em>Out On A Limb</em> is a brilliant revelation about black bears and a paean to human potential. After decades spent caring for orphan bears and releasing them into the wild, Ben Kilham, a dyslexic animal lover, has now summarized what he has learned about their rich social complexity and humanlike intentionality. The result is to turn a supposedly familiar species into a creature of unsuspected acuity. Part science, part intuition, this enticing natural history is a provocative argument about animal minds, and an intimate celebration of life in the New Hampshire woods."<strong>--Richard Wrangham, author of <em>Catching Fire: How Cooking Made us Human</em>; co-director of the Kibale Chimpanzee Project</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Out on a Limb</em> by Benjamin Kilham is one of the finest books on the natural history of an animal that I have ever read. As gripping as the best novel, it is very readable and provides great insights into the mind of the black bear and the human. The research that Kilham has done on the behavior of black bears is groundbreaking and will lead us to a much better understanding of the development of intelligence in mammals and the evolution of cognition throughout the animal world."<strong>--James R. Spotila, Betz Chair Professor of Environmental Science, Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science, Drexel University; author of <em>Saving Sea Turtles</em></strong></p> <p><em><br> <br> </em>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>"Like Jane Goodall&#x2019;s studies of chimps, Ben Kilham&#x2019;s work with black bears is more than just revealing: it&#x2019;s revolutionary. This riveting book supports two astonishing conclusions:&nbsp; that bears are far more sophisticated than most scientists dared imagine, and that dyslexia, once considered a failing, may simply be another, and often valuable, way of thinking. Ben&#x2019;s work will transform our understanding of&nbsp; how animals live--and how science should be done."<strong>--Sy Montgomery, author of <em>Walking with the Great Apes</em> and <em>Search for the Golden Moon Bear</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Ben Kilham's <em>Out On A Limb </em>is surely the most&nbsp; insightful book about animals written in the last 100 years. His observation of black bears is the best ever done, his data is flawless, and these attributes have created a landmark of science that as far as I know has not been equalled with any other species. And if that&#x2019;s not enough, it&#x2019;s also a page-turner and a must-read. It left me breathless."<strong>--Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of <em>The Hidden Life of Dogs </em>and<em> The Tribe of Tiger</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>"The author is a state-sponsored researcher whose work with the black bear population in northern New Hampshire is safe, methodical and sanctioned. Since he does not currently hold a doctorate&#x2015;he&#x2019;s now working on that&#x2015;much of his fieldwork has been discounted by the scientific community. On the other hand, his outsider status has allowed him to go his own way and trust in his natural skills rather than bemoan his shortcomings revolving around his dyslexia. Despite his condition, he is blessed with the ability to recognize patterns and see systems where they are not self-evident. The tone of his presentation allays criticism or hostility with its frankness and generosity, as he plunges into what he has observed: how bears use scent and body language, how they compete and cooperate, how they enforce house rules and exhibit a social code of justice and punishment, and how they communicate.&nbsp; Though he has interacted with hundreds of black bears, one in particular&#x2015;Squirty, whom he adopted as a cub and released into the wild&#x2015;has allowed Kilham to experience an intimate association with him, from comfort to anger and many other emotions in between. The author presents a solid case for bears as primal actors of social exchange&#x2015;cooperation, altruism, morality&#x2015;and their study, a 'gateway' to understanding 'how surplus fitness and an increase in population density have affected human behavior.' A powerfully original study of bears."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong><br> "For nearly 20 years, naturalist Kilham has fostered orphaned black bear cubs in northern New Hampshire. In his previous book, <em>Among the Bears, Raising Orphan Cubs in the Wild </em>(2002), he described his early efforts to teach cubs to forage, hunt, and avoid natural and human-made dangers. In this book, he recounts years of studying bears he released into the woods, especially Squirty, who has successfully raised her own cubs, who have in turn raised another generation of wild bears. Because Squirty still trusts Kilham as family, he has been able to observe bear social interactions closely. Among his discoveries are that bears socialize far more than commonly believed and occasionally exhibit altruistic behavior. Although some scientists criticize Kilham&#x2019;s work, he defends his methods and likens bear society to that of primitive humans, suggesting that we can learn much about our origins from the bears. Advice for hikers encountering bears rounds out this popular-science memoir."</p> <p><br> <br> &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement</h2><p>In 1944, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, knowing that high-ranking members of the military had testified falsely before the various bodies investigating Pearl Harbor, selected a lowly major and young lawyer named Henry C. Clausen and gave him extraordinary authority to go anywhere and question anyone under oath, from enlisted personnel right up to Chief of Staff George C. Marshall. To this day, no member of the public knows the full story of Clausen's investigation. Over seven months during 1944 and 1945, Clausen traveled more than 55,000 miles to interview and obtain sworn affidavits from nearly one hundred Army, Navy, civilian, and British personnel. Many of these people never testified before any other inquiry, including Congress. Clausen wore a self-destructing case containing ultrasecret decoded Japanese messages that forced witnesses to tell the truth and opened files that revealed a massive, inconceivable failure to exploit the priceless intelligence obtained by the United States in the months prior to Pearl Harbor.<br>Clausen presented an 800-page report to Secretary of War Stimson - but because his report was Top Secret, he did not write a conclusion. That conclusion, and in fact Clausen's entire Top Secret report, would have torn apart the government of the United States and revealed the breathtaking secret capability of the Allies to crack Japanese and German codes. Henry Clausen is the last major living witness, the one person who can reveal, fifty years afterward, the real truth about Pearl Harbor. His "final judgement" puts an end to all the conspiracy theories mistakenly based on perjured testimony and self-serving misinformation that continue to pollute the historical record.</p><p><b>Henry C. Clausen</b> lived and practiced law in San Francisco. He died in 1993. <b>Bruce Lee</b>, in a long and distinguished publishing career, has been editor-researcher for Cornelius Ryan and the editor of Gordon Prange, Admiral Edwin T. Layton, Ronald Lewin, Gordon Wekhman, William Craig, Ralph Bennett, and Charles B. MacDonald. He lives in New York City.This book goes a long way toward ending the 50-year-old debate as to how the Japanese managed to surprise U.S. forces when they bombed Hawaii on December 7, 1941. In 1944, Secretary of War Henry Stimson selected co-author Clausen, then a lawyer in the U.S. Judge Advocate's office, to conduct an independent investigation into the Pearl Harbor attack; Clausen submitted a top-secret report on the matter, the substance of which is published here for the first time. Assisted by New York-based editor Lee, Clausen details his discovery of egregious errors of omission and commission, as well as criminal neglect of duty by the Army and Navy high command in Washington and Honolulu. He concludes that the top officers in Hawaii, General Walter Short and Admiral Husband Kimmel, were simply asleep at the switch and ignored repeated warnings. Probably the most telling factor in this failure of communication, he argues, was the Navy's arrogant hoarding of secret intelligence that should have been shared with its Army counterparts. This thoroughly engrossing narrative, as compelling as a detective novel, answers two major questions: What did Washington and Honolulu know about Japanese actions before the attack and what did they do about it? A significant historical breakthrough that should attract a wide readership.

U.S. Manned Space From Mercury to the Shuttle</h2><p>An autobiography by one of America&#39;s original astronauts, who later headed the astronaut program, chronicles Slayton&#39;s life as a war hero and space shuttle pilot</p><p><p><b>Deke Slayton</b> was one of the first seven Mercury astronauts--and he might have been the first American in space. Instead, he became the first chief of American Astronaut Corps. It was Deke Slayton who selected the crews who flew the Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab missions. It was Deke Slayton who made Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon.</p><p><strong>1</strong><br><br><strong>Beginnings</strong><br>I guess when it comes to space and aviation, I&#x2019;ve seen and done a lot in fifty years. My name isn&#x2019;t the first one to come to mind when somebody says the word <em>astronaut</em>, but I was one of the original Mercury guys--the one who got screwed out of a mission for medical reasons. I hung in there and wound up running the Astronaut Office. Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon because I selected him. I eventually got into space, however, on Apollo-Soyuz--thirteen years after I should have.<br>When I was four years old, growing up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin, I was fond of running across the country road to the neighbor&#x2019;s place. There wasn&#x2019;t much traffic on that road, but my mother was terrified that I&#x2019;d get hit by a truck. With three other children younger than me, she had her hands full and her eyes elsewhere.<br>So whenever she let me out into the front yard, she tied me to a tree with a rope. I was tethered like a puppy. I could run around, but only so far. I certainly couldn&#x2019;t reach the road.<br>Eventually I convinced my mother that I wasn&#x2019;t going to go running into the road, and I was set free. But I can make the case that ever since I was young I have wanted to explore...and people have tried to stop me.<br>* * *<br>It&#x2019;s not as though there was anywhere to run to. The Slayton farm was a mile north of Leon, Wisconsin, which itself wasn&#x2019;t much more than a wide spot in Highway 27, which runs south of the city of Sparta. Sparta was a small town in those days--I remember the population well, because it was the same as the number of feet in a mile--5,280. I think it&#x2019;s now grown almost to a nautical mile, 6,010 or something.<br>In 1959, the year I was selected as a Mercury astronaut, Leon&#x2019;s population was 150. It probably still is, for all I know. It had a general store named the Farmer&#x2019;s Store, a feed mill, a couple of filling stations, a garage, and two farm implement dealers.<br>I had an older half sister, Verna, and an older half brother, Elwood. My dad, Charles Sherman Slayton, was married once before, but his first wife died when Elwood was born. Elwood was farmed out to an aunt to raise, so he was more like a cousin than a brother...he didn&#x2019;t live with us.<br>Verna, who was four years older than Elwood, did live with us. She eventually died of multiple sclerosis. Elwood is still up in Wisconsin.<br>My dad remarried to Victoria Larson, and I&#x2019;m the oldest from the second marriage. I&#x2019;ve got a brother, Howard, one year younger. A sister, Bev, a year younger than he is. A sister, Marie--she&#x2019;s two years younger than Bev. My youngest brother, Dick, is nine years younger than I am. So that&#x2019;s the family.<br>I should point out that to my family, and to the rest of the world until I was in my thirties, I was always Don Slayton. Nobody called me Deke until I became a test pilot at Edwards in the 1950s.<br>Slayton is supposed to be English, but three of my grandparents came from Norway. The English one we&#x2019;ve traced back to New England somewhere. My dad used to say he was probably a cabin boy or horse thief. There are a lot of Slaytons around the country, I&#x2019;ve discovered. I go someplace and somebody pops up to say he&#x2019;s my relative via this channel, forty times removed.<br>My dad was an avid reader, even though all he had was an eighth grade education. He took the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>and the <em>Farm Journal</em>. When I was a little older he even became the township tax collector, but managed to stay liked by everyone.<br>He took jobs because farming was a tough way to make a living, especially in the thirties. Nobody had money in those days and by most standards we were poor. We reused Christmas and Valentine&#x2019;s Day cards to save a few pennies. But, fortunately, being on a farm, we never worried about starving to death. We always had plenty of good, healthy food to eat. We didn&#x2019;t have fancy clothes, but for farming all you need are old overalls.<br>My dad used to go out and run a road grader for the county, building roads. That&#x2019;s how we got cash. Verna&#x2019;s husband really ran the farm.<br>Entertainment was a luxury. I do recall being taken into Sparta once to see my first movie, which turned out to be some Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald thing. My parents must have liked it, but I didn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ve hardly been to a movie since.<br>We didn&#x2019;t even have a radio until I got to high school, because we didn&#x2019;t have electricity. For a while we had a Delco battery plant set up in the basement of the house. That gave us electricity for lights, but not much. It was only after I left in 1942 that we got 110-volt electricity.<br>No indoor plumbing, either. That didn&#x2019;t come in until we got electricity.<br>(Growing up the way I did, I&#x2019;m still amazed at the number of things that are electrical these days. Once I had a conversation with a guy about nuclear war and nuclear winter. He was telling me it wouldn&#x2019;t bother him: he&#x2019;d just jump in his car and head out to the country. I pointed out that his car probably had an electronic ignition and if he tried to put gas in the car the pumps were also electrical.)<br>Fishing was something we did all the time. There was a stream down in back, half a mile from where we lived. All you had to do was cut a cane pole and get a piece of string; hooks were cheap. You could get a lot of entertainment for very little.<br>I also started hunting when I was very young: I was using a gun from the time I was six years old, and bought an old sixteen-gauge shotgun--single shot--when I was eight or nine. I think I paid a dollar and a half for it. It didn&#x2019;t work half the time. It had an outside hammer. I can&#x2019;t remember how many times I&#x2019;d find a rabbit and pull to shoot the son of a gun and the gun would misfire. You could say I did a lot of unintended game conservation in those days.<br>We also learned how to deal with animals. These days everybody&#x2019;s got pets, and we&#x2019;re probably giving more feed to them than we are to farm animals. When I was young, people would usually have a family dog around, maybe a few stray cats, but nobody paid much attention to them. My wife, Bobbie, and I have some little Lhassa apsos--it gets down to forty degrees and you&#x2019;ve got to get those little guys inside or they&#x2019;ll freeze. But those old farm dogs, it would get down below zero and they&#x2019;d just dig a hole in a hay bale--or in the snow--and curl up, spend the night. Animals are pretty tough if they&#x2019;re on their own.<br>We also had some sheep. I remember grinding an old mechanical shaft that runs the shearing scissors. You&#x2019;d usually cut chunks out of the hide here and there, grab a slab of pine tar, slap it on the wound, and off they&#x2019;d go.<br>We sold a few eggs, anything that would get a penny here or there. Today my brother doesn&#x2019;t have any chickens...no pigs...no sheep, nothing. He&#x2019;s got dairy cows and that&#x2019;s it.<br>The problem is, he&#x2019;s got about half a million dollars invested in machinery. You need about five to six hundred acres to make any financial sense out of it, and he&#x2019;s only got a couple hundred. So when he was more active (and I guess his son-in-law still is) he did a lot of job-shopping for other people. He&#x2019;d do his own combining, then he&#x2019;d go combine for some other people.<br>You can&#x2019;t find farm labor; you&#x2019;ve got to have the machinery. And you&#x2019;ve got to have a big base of land to make the machinery pay. Howard&#x2019;s got three tractors, for example, which is just a hell of a capital investment.<br>Lot of people are just selling off the land or moving out of the farm. There are bigger and bigger chunks with less people. The old family farm is a thing of the past. It happened pretty fast, too.<br>I always thought the Russians could reset to where we were about 1939. They&#x2019;ve got the people and that style of farming is manpower intensive.<br>* * *<br>I had to pump water and carry wood before I even started going to school. I started milking cows, first thing morning and night, when I was probably six years old. With our cows in the wintertime, you had to pitch hay and feed in front of them, and shovel manure out from behind them, every day. Summertime they ran in the pasture, so it was a little easier.<br>The crops we raised were mostly to feed the cattle. Corn and hay and oats. Of course, we didn&#x2019;t have a tractor, we had four horses. The oats were raised for the horses.<br>Harvesting was just plain manual labor. Mow the hay down and let it dry, windrow it. Then it was just hand work. Get a pitchfork and stack it...come out with the wagons and pitch it onto the wagons, haul it into the barn. Then you&#x2019;d lift it up to the hay mow and pitch it around up there. It was hot, dirty work, but it was good for you. Today they just chop it and blow it into a silo or bale it. One guy can do a hell of a lot of hay in a day.<br>We had threshing parties where all the neighbors would get together and travel from one farm to the other. You had one guy who was running the threshing machine, which he&#x2019;d rented out, and he&#x2019;d come to our farm for the day. All the surrounding neighbors would come in with their wagons and haul in the bundles of oats and corn. Some people would do that while others would carry the grain to the granary. When you finished that guy&#x2019;s crops, you headed down the road to the next guy&#x2019;s.<br>The family that was getting the work was always obligated to feed the crew. Ladies would chip in with cooking, too. Some of the biggest meals I&#x2019;ve ever had were threshing meals.<br>That happened three times a year--one was the grain threshing, another was when they were filling the silos with green corn. And the last time would be late in the fall, when the corn had matured and you were shredding the corn off the stalks. But it was basically th...</p></p><h2>The Death and Life of Aida Hernandez: A Border Story</h2><p><p><b>What happens when an undocumented teen mother takes on the U.S. immigration system?</b></p><p>When Aida Hernandez was born in 1987 in Agua Prieta, Mexico, the nearby U.S. border was little more than a worn-down fence.

Mitchell was a rebellious child, an independent woman who wanted a career and not a family (children made her wince), and a Catholic who defiantly left the Church, divorced her first husband, Red Upshaw (a ne'er-do-well and sometime bootlegger), and married John Marsh (who had been Upshaw's best man). Fans of <em>Gone With the Wind</em> will find several chapters in <em>Southern Daughter</em> that trace how these elements in Mitchell's biography made their way into her fiction, including the most surprising identity for the fictional Rhett Butler. As a further surprise to most Americans who know only the film version of <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, Pyron reveals how Mitchell intended her book as a repudiation of the then popular "moonlight on the magnolias" genre of Civil War romance. Equally interesting is his portrait of Mitchell after the novel's success: the incredible flood of letters (in the 13 years before her death, Mitchell wrote at least ten thousand letters, an astonishing number of which ran pages and pages); the filming of <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, whose script ultimately required seventeen writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ben Hecht; and the lavish film premier in Atlanta.<br> Whether describing Mitchell's earliest writing (such as <em>The Cow Puncher</em> and <em>Phil Kelley, Detective</em>, in which she played Zara the female crook), or discussing her final years, which were marred by constant pain and illness, wrangles with agents and publisher, and her increasing affection for litigation, this perceptive, sympathetic, and engagingly written biography illuminates the life of a major writer and the book she created, a work peopled with characters who still loom large in the American imagination.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Darden Asbury Pyron</strong> is Professor of History at Florida International University.<br>Pyron (History/Florida International Univ.) offers a compelling portrait of the spirited, complex author of Gone With the Wind, a perceptive psychological analysis of the novel, and an examination of the work's changing critical fortunes as the South has become transformed during the past half century. Pyron takes a while to gain momentum as she details Mitchell's aristocratic Atlantan heritage, her forebears, and her early childhood. But once Mitchell takes the spotlight as a wild, beautiful, talented, and witty young woman, the reader is swept right along through the ensuing hundreds of pages. There emerges a fascinating portrait of a woman who contained, to paraphrase Walt Whitman, contradictory multitudes. She was repelled by sex but relished pornography. She was a gentleborn Atlanta deb, yet in her job for the Atlanta Journal she loved drinking the boys under the table and fearlessly entered the worst prisons and neighborhoods in the town. She was intensely private (Gone With the Wind was written in furiously guarded secrecy), and yet after the book's publication she answered every fan letter herself, a monumental outpouring of correspondence that prevented her from ever having the time or energy for fiction again. The Cinderella transformation of an obscure fledgling novelist into a superstar of a magnitude incredible even in this day of hype makes riveting reading. The scope of Pyron's book is enormous, ranging from the intimate- -Mitchell's deeply ambivalent relationship with her feminist mother that lay at the heart of Gone With the Wind--to the global--the intense responses to the book from people all over the world who saw in Mitchell's depiction of the throes of the Confederacy an image of their own struggles in WW II and its aftermath. Cyclonic--and it couldn't be more timely, with the publication of the sequel to Mitchell's classic just around the corner. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Everyone knows the blacksmith, Elias, liked to drink and liked the ladies. Everyone knows his wife, Isabella, had been spotted many a time entering the woods with men other than her husband. And everyone knows the couple fought, sometimes violently.<br>But could they have independently, and on the same day - the festive eve of Michaelmas - murdered each other with two entirely different poisons? The village's medicine woman, Mother Croul, doesn't think so. And neither does Kathryn Swinbrooke, Physician of Canterbury, who is in town with her new husband, Colum Murtagh.<br>Kathryn and Colum are visiting on state business: Lord Henry Beauchamp is to receive the shadowy emissaries of Louis XI of France, on behalf of his own master, Edward of York, only recently triumphant over Lancastrian forces in the bloody, fratricidal War of the Roses. The Frenchmen claim to have the ultimate bargaining chip - but do they?<br>It is a tense time for the kingdom; everything hinges on the meeting between Lord Henry and the French agents. Now murder stalks the land, and only Kathryn Swinbrooke can cut through the web of murder and deceit that seems to arrive with the Spider King's minions.</p><p>It's not easy being a physician, a detective, and a new bride in late-fifteenth-century England, but Kathryn Swinbrook manages. This latest entry in the series that includes <i>A Maze of Murders</i> (2002) is once again full of death and historical detail, the latter delivered without putting readers to sleep. Kathryn and her new husband, Colum, are caught up in a spider's web of political intrigue spun by Louis XI, known as the Spider King. Also tangled in the web are the local murders of a blacksmith and his wife, both poisoned on the same day in ways and for reasons no one understands. Grace (the pseudonym of genre veteran Paul Doherty) spins a web of his own with this well-wrought tale, which includes a nicely interwoven gay-themed subplot.

This biography draws on his public and private writings, which illustrate his lifelong effort to recover Christianity&#39;s true essence - from a childhood enthusiasm for theology, through periods spent in America and England, to ministry in Berlin and the decision that a moral obligation to resist state violence required him to commit treason.</p><p>Charles Marsh is a professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia and director of the Project on Lived Theology.

Of Marsh&#x2019;s earlier volumes <i>Reclaiming Bonhoeffer,</i> the late Eberhand Bethge, Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s closest friend and first biographer, wrote: &#x201c;This book is a theological sensation&#x2014;an exciting event.

The ritual eventually became a game, with each child concentrating on the word to clear the mind of distractions. And on funeral days, as horse-�drawn hearses approached the cemetery that lay just to the north, the twins would watch from their bedroom window.<br><br>Eternity. Ewigkeit.<br><br>Sabine found the word &#x201c;very long and gruesome.&#x201d; Dietrich found it majestic: an &#x201c;awesome word,&#x201d; he called it.<br><br>Sometimes he would picture himself on his deathbed, surrounded by family and friends, reclining on the threshold of heaven. He knew what his last words would be and sometimes rehearsed them aloud, though he dared not reveal them to anyone.He hoped to welcome death as an expected guest&#x2014;�he did not want to be taken by surprise. But, sometimes, when he went to bed convinced that death would come that very night, he would grow light-�headed, and the walls of his bedroom would reel about, as if he were at the axis of a carousel. He imagined himself rushing from sister to brother, from father to mother, pleading for help. The prospect of its happening now&#x2014;�of his vanishing tonight into the vast mysterium&#x2014;felt so real he had to bite his tongue to reassure himself that he was still among the living. That he could feel mortal pain. At such moments, he worried that he suffered from an &#x201c;incurable fear.&#x201d;<br><br>When the twins got separate bedrooms they devised a code for keeping up their metaphysical games. Dietrich would drum lightly on the wall with his fingers, an &#x201c;admonitory knock&#x201d; announcing that it was time once again to ponder eternity. A further tap signaled a new reflection on the solemn theme, and so it went, back and forth, until one of them discerned the final silence&#x2014;usually it was Dietrich. And with the game concluded, he lay awake, the only light in his room coming from a pair of candle-�lit crosses his mother had placed atop a corner table. &#x201c;When at night I go to bed, fourteen angels round my stead,&#x201d; he would hear her sing. He liked the idea very much: one angel &#x201c;dressed in a little white cloak,&#x201d; standing by his bed, and others watching over children everywhere.<br><br>Dietrich believed the nightly ritual spared him from &#x201c;being devoured by Satan,&#x201d; Sabine later wrote, though there are few references to Satan in her brother&#x2019;s adult writings, early or late. Ultimately, death would enthrall more than it frightened, and the devil would frighten him hardly at all. &#x201c;God does not want human beings to be afraid,&#x201d; he would one day preach to the congregation in a posh London suburb. God&#x2019;s only desire is that people &#x201c;reach out &#x2018;passionately&#x2019; and &#x2018;hungrily&#x2019; for mercy and love and . . . grace.&#x201d;<br><br>Unlike most Protestant theologians of the twentieth century, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was not the child of a minister. The sixth of eight children (his twin being the seventh), he was born on February 4, 1906, in Breslau, into a family of prodigiously talented humanists, who preferred spending religious holidays in the festive company of relatives and friends rather than in church. &#x201c;Popguns, soldiers!&#x201d; he wrote in his first letter to Father Christmas. Over the years he would ask for musical instruments, suits of clothes, fur hats, shirts and ties, trips abroad, shoes for every occasion, and the works of Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel. His wishes were most often granted.<br><br>The family lived at 9 Birkenw�ldchen Strasse in the affluent Breslau suburb of Scheitnig. Across the street a narrow park traced the bend in the Alte Oder River south beyond the Dombr�cke to the city zoo and Bishop&#x2019;s Forests; to the north, a path cut through dense pine woods to the cemetery and to the psychiatry and nerve clinic, where Dietrich&#x2019;s father worked. Sabine recalled a summer afternoon when her twin brother disappeared after the call to dinner. It was during a heat wave in lower Silesia. Dietrich, tanned and sporting &#x201c;a shock of flaxen hair,&#x201d; had been larking about in the backyard hoping to ward off the midges. Finally, he took shelter in a garden niche deep in the overgrown field between the rose arbor and the edge of the property. As his nursemaid stood on the veranda, repeating the dinner call, Dietrich paid no mind. Heedless of the heat and the fading light, he was content in the solitude of his secret place in the summer garden.<br><br>With its thick walls, narrow windows, and piercing spires, the house stood on the eastern bank of the Alte Oder, off a cobblestone street abutting another narrow wood. Arches and corbels enlivened the brickwork, and touches of Gothic-�Baroque appeared in the finials, overhangs, and trussing. A hipped roof and screened-�in porch entry, with deep eaves and dormer and eyebrow windows, gave the impression of a Low German farmhouse extending whimsically in every direction.<br><br>But for the rose arbor and a small vegetable garden, both carefully tended, the backyard was left to grow wild, according to fashion. Hens and roosters skittered about the yard and across the aging tennis court. Goats and sheep roamed freely in and out of the stables and even into the house when the doors were left open. Dietrich&#x2019;s mother kept a children&#x2019;s zoo with &#x201c;rabbits, guinea pigs, turtledoves, and squirrels,&#x201d; a terrarium with lizards, and snakes, and &#x201c;collections of birds&#x2019; eggs and mounted beetles and butterflies.&#x201d; In the shade of a linden tree, Dietrich&#x2019;s father and older brothers built a tree house on dark piers, a latticework affair with a small stage for skits. One summer, Dietrich helped those same older siblings dig an underground passageway from the arbor to a boulder. Beyond the family&#x2019;s three acres lay what the neighborhood children called &#x201c;the wilderness.&#x201d; There the land rolled softy toward the river and into a bog where they collected algae, worms, lizards, and bullfrogs for their terrariums and things to inspect under their microscopes.<br><br>Word that the family was moving to Berlin, more than three hundred kilometers from Breslau, came as a surprise to the children and elicited grumbling in the ranks. In 1912, the year Dietrich turned six, Dr. Karl Bonhoeffer was offered the chair of neurology and psychology at Friedrich-�Wilhelms-�University in Berlin, a prestigious post overseeing the clinic for nervous and psychiatric disorders. At Breslau, which had numbered Max Born, Erwin Schr�dinger, Fritz Haber, and Otto Stern among its many Nobel laureates, his position had been more than respectable. But Berlin offered greater prominence for Karl&#x2019;s clinical studies&#x2014;�along with a better salary and &#x201c;more possibilities&#x201d; for the children&#x2019;s development. And the metropolis of two million held great potential for cases of hysterics and addiction to study.<br><br>At first, the family rented a place on the Br�ckenallee, a street that no longer exists, near the Tiergarten, the former royal hunting estate that had become a public park, where Dietrich and Sabine might see the kaiser&#x2019;s children also at play. Four years later, Dr. Bonhoeffer purchased a three-�story Gr�nderzeit-�Villa in Grunewald. The suburb had been the brainchild of Otto von Bismarck, the first chancellor of the German empire, who set aside a large parcel of pristine forest to be developed as a residential district. A colony of grand country houses in a variety of architectural styles, Grunewald, or &#x201c;green forest,&#x201d; was the ideal rus in urbe, offering rural atmosphere within reach of urban amenities, while keeping the city&#x2019;s grittier aspects at bay. Scientists, statesmen, and scholars, filmmakers and movie stars, financiers and industrialists, all promenaded along the same leafy boulevards and mingled together at neighborhood soir�es. In the summer, canopies of linden and birch shaded the paved streets, and the woodlands to the south seemed to entwine the neighborhood&#x2019;s generously proportioned blocks. The writer Christopher Isherwood, who in the 1920s rented a flat in a noisy working-�class urban district, called Grunewald a &#x201c;millionaire&#x2019;s slum.&#x201d;<br><br>The Bonhoeffers warmed to their new home at 14 Wangenheimstrasse. Though smaller than their rented Breslau villa, the house was elegant and lean, built in the style of a classic German country home, with a hip, shingled roof, a bow front dormer, and a clinker brick face on the basement socle. There was also a deep yard, a large veranda facing the garden, and an office suite for Dr. Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s home clinic. On mild days, music drifting through the open windows could be heard in the garden of primroses and young bracken. &#x201c;An unobtrusive wealth and an uninhibited taste for pleasure and comfort,&#x201d; Bonhoeffer wrote in his unfinished autobiographical novel. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t so much the importance of the individual object that pleased the eye and warmed the heart as the solicitous care given to the whole.&#x201d;<br><br>Inside, the plain cedar floors, crafted to the highest German standards, were well worn. A &#x201c;thick, plaited mat covered the parquet floor&#x201d; in the front hall, there being no need, as the lady of the house, Paula Bonhoeffer, saw it, for children &#x201c;to run across Persian rugs before they knew how to keep their shoes clean.&#x201d; The appointments were simple and sturdy throughout, made to last of top-�quality wood and fittings. Beyond the foyer was an enormous living room (twenty meters wide, twenty-�five meters deep) that the Bonhoeffer family called simply das Zimmer, &#x201c;the room,&#x201d; or, if necessary, das grosse Zimmer, &#x201c;the big room,&#x201d; but never der Salon, the &#x201c;parlor,&#x201d; which to Paula&#x2019;s ear sounded pretentious. A massive dining table, the wood engraved on all sides, could comfortably seat a dozen in chairs of dark Bavarian timber. On the sideboard, Julie Tafel Bonhoeffer, the children&#x2019;s grandmother, who lived in T�bingen until moving to Berlin with her housekeeper in 1925, kept an antique silver box from which she occasionally drew pieces of chocolate to treat the little ones.<br><br>Family portraits and austere landscapes, many now hanging in Munich&#x2019;s Neue Pinakothek or in Hamburg&#x2019;s Kunsthalle, graced the spacious rooms downstairs. Some of the paintings were by Franz von Lenbach, the brothers Achenbach, and Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, but most were the work of Dietrich&#x2019;s great-�uncle, Leopold Graf von Kalckreuth, and his father, Stanislaus Graf von Kalckreuth. Of them all, Dietrich best liked the portrait of his great-�grandfather August von Hase, over a corner sofa. In the painting, the aging provost, for decades a distinguished professor of church at Jena, kneels before a crucifix, holding an empty hourglass.<br><br>With the help of a small army of servants&#x2014;�chambermaids, housekeepers, a cook and a gardener, a governess for each of the older children, a nurse for the small ones&#x2014;�Paula was praised for keeping a well-�tuned, comfortable, and stimulating home. After the move to Berlin a receptionist for Dr. Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s private clinic, housed in two side rooms off the main floor, was also hired, as well as a chauffeur.<br><br>The earliest German descendants of the Dutch clan van den Boenhoff left Nijmegen in 1513, settling in Schw�bisch Hall as goldsmiths, aldermen, and landowners. On the family seal a lion clutches some beans, against a blue field. Roughly translated, &#x201c;Boenhoff&#x201d; means &#x201c;beanfield.&#x201d; But by the nineteenth century, the family had achieved prominence in law, medicine, and the Lutheran Church.<br><br>Karl Bonhoeffer was the son of Judge Friedrich Ernst Philipp Tobias Bonhoeffer, a lawyer who served most of his life as president of the provincial court in Ulm. A contrary and emotionally distant man, he was a &#x201c;firm enemy of everything faddish and unnatural.&#x201d; He abhorred buses and trains, remaining convinced that any journey of less than sixty kilometers was better undertaken on foot, when all the transfers and inevitable delays were factored in. This meant that, for holiday visits, Karl and his siblings would have to walk the forty kilometers from T�bingen to their grandparents&#x2019; home in Stuttgart. Each spring the judge trekked alone through the Swabian Alps with a burlap bag of radish seeds, which he scattered Johnny Appleseed style, returning in the autumn to collect the harvest.<br><br>Karl Bonhoeffer inherited his father&#x2019;s exactitude and his aloofness, though not, it appears, his short temper. Outwardly gentler than the judge, Karl nevertheless demanded as much of his children as of himself. This was especially so of the way the children formulated their thoughts and expressed themselves. He expected precise and measured judgments, brooking no &#x201c;spontaneous utterances&#x201d; or banter in his home. Any child with something to say in the presence of adults had better choose his words carefully. Not that Karl was uninterested in his children&#x2019;s opinions; rather, he took pleasure in clarity of argument. A word spoken in haste or a half-�baked thought made him visibly unhappy. He could bring a child to attention by asking, &#x201c;Was sagst du?&#x201d;&#x2014;�&#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d; He may never have raised his voice, but he rarely embraced or kissed his children.<br><br>Karl subscribed to an enlightened skepticism toward the miraculous and the supernatural, toward any belief that contradicted the laws of reason. He accepted his wife&#x2019;s instructing the children in religion only in measured doses, and so long as it served a useful purpose. Nearly two decades of clinical work in empirical psychiatry and neurology had inclined him to think of religion as a tool that might sometimes help people order their lives and ward off chaos&#x2014;�although he felt there were better alternatives. He chose not to accompany his wife and younger children to the Lutheran Church of Grunewald they attended now and then, and he steered clear of the Sunday-�afternoon social hours that Paula convened over coffee and cake, with hymns sung around the piano. The twins&#x2019; religious formation was of more importance to their mother than that of the older children, perhaps because of her awareness of the boy&#x2019;s spiritual predilections. Karl Bonhoeffer did not oppose baptisms and confirmations&#x2014;�if they included a celebration in a spring garden, he rather enjoyed them&#x2014;�but he preferred to keep the Sabbath in his own way. It was his custom, after the evening meal, to gather the family in the library and read aloud stories, poems, and letters. Theodor Fontane and Friedrich Schiller were his favorites, though he also read from Fyodor Dostoevsky, Hermann Hesse, and Fritz Reuter, the popular nineteenth-�century chronicler of rural life. This was much more intellectually satisfying than religion, or psychoanalysis, which he criticized forthrightly for encouraging the same sort of meandering speech and speculative indulgences he found so insufferable. &#x201c;I understand nothing of that,&#x201d; he once said with a sigh after his wife had read the Advent story from the Gospel of Luke. He was only too happy to delegate stories of angels and virgin births to her capable care.<br><br>Paula Bonhoeffer was the daughter of Karl Alfred von Hase and Clara Gr�fin von Hase, n�e Countess Kalckreuth. Karl Alfred had been chaplain to the emperor at the Potsdam Garrison Church, and his father, the aforementioned nineteenth-�century church historian of some distinction. Paula&#x2019;s blue eyes, blond hair, and open, confident face set a striking contrast to her husband&#x2019;s pursed lips and melancholy eyes.</p><h2>The Healing Path of Yoga: Time-Honored Wisdom and Scientifically Proven Methods That Alleviate Stress, Open Your Heart, and Enrich Your Life</h2><p>Stress is now considered the foremost contributor to poor health and a major factor in causing heart disease, cancer, and a myriad of chronic and acute diseases.

"Recent medical research by well-known clinicians shows that stress is a major factor in causing heart disease, cancer, and a myriad of chronic and acute diseases of today's world," according to author and revered instructor Nischala Joy Devi, who has pioneered yoga programs for heart specialist Dean Ornish and cancer specialist Michael Lerner. "While the stressful events around us may not change, we can learn how to respond quickly to life's difficulties, maintaining our equilibrium and a sense of well-being."<p> Although the practice of yoga can create this well-being and has even been associated with reversing serious medical conditions such as hypertension and heart disease, Devi never makes grandiose promises. Instead, she shows readers how yoga can be realistically integrated into a contemporary lifestyle. Forget the contorted poses and mysterious religious overtones associated with yoga. Think "attitude adjustments" as Devi offers suggestions for opening the heart, achieving deeper rest and relaxation, breathing more effectively, and learning to meditate. Toward the end she addresses the physical plane with a well-illustrated routine of <i>easy</i> physical poses (<i>asanas</i>) as well as chapters on "Eating for Wholeness" and "Prelude to Sleep." Devi is indeed a masterful yoga teacher. Not only does she blend Eastern philosophy with Western living, she does it in a way that is grounded, approachable, and thoroughly welcoming for people from all walks of life. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>"Whether you have never practiced yoga and meditation or you practice daily, Nischala Devi will help bring you to the next level.

We&#x2019;re going to take you out of the ambulance now and into the emergency room.&#x201d;<br> <br>Shivering uncontrollably, Leigh Kendall reacted to the insistent male voice that was calling her back to consciousness, but she couldn&#x2019;t Seem to summon the strength to open her eyelids.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you hear me, Miss Kendall?&#x201d;<br> <br>With an effort, she finally managed to force her eyes open. The doctor who had spoken was bending over her, examining her head, and beside him, a nurse was holding a clear plastic bag of IV fluid.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to take you out of the ambulance now,&#x201d; he repeated as he beamed a tiny light at each of her pupils.<br> <br>&#x201c;Need . . . to tell . . . husband I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Leigh managed in a feeble whisper.<br> <br>He nodded and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. &#x201c;The state police will take care of that. In the meantime, you have some very big fans at Good Samaritan, including me, and we&#x2019;re going to take excellent care of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Voices and images began to fly at Leigh from every direction as the gurney was lifted from the ambulance. Red and blue lights pulsed frantically against a gray dawn sky. People in uniforms flashed past her line of vision&#x2014;New York State troopers, paramedics, doctors, nurses. Doors swung open, the hallway flew by, faces crowded around her, firing urgent questions at her.<br> <br>Leigh tried to concentrate, but their voices were collapsing into an incomprehensible babble, and their features were sliding off their faces, dissolving into the same blackness that had already devoured the rest of the room.<br> <br>WHEN LEIGH AWOKE AGAIN, it was dark outside and a light snow was falling. Struggling to free herself from the effects of whatever drugs were dripping into her arm from the IV bag above her, she gazed dazedly at what appeared to be a hospital room filled with a riotous display of flowers.<br> <br>Seated on a chair near the foot of the bed, flanked by a huge basket of white orchids and a large vase of bright yellow roses, a gray-haired nurse was reading a copy of the New York Post with Leigh&#x2019;s picture on the front page.<br> <br>Leigh turned her head as much as the brace on her neck would allow, searching for some sign of Logan, but for the time being, she was alone with the nurse. Experimentally, she moved her legs and wiggled her toes, and was relieved to find them still attached to the rest of her and in reasonably good working order. Her arms were bandaged and her head was wrapped in something tight, but as long as she didn&#x2019;t move, her discomfort seemed to be limited to a generalized ache throughout her body, a sharper ache in her ribs, and a throat so dry it felt as if it were stuffed with sawdust.<br> <br>She was alive, and that in itself was a miracle! The fact that she was also whole and relatively unharmed filled Leigh with a sense of gratitude and joy that was almost euphoric. She swallowed and forced a croaking whisper from her parched throat. &#x201c;May I have some water?&#x201d;<br> <br>The nurse looked up, a professional smile instantly brightening her face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re awake!&#x201d; she said as she quickly closed the newspaper, folded it in half, and laid it facedown beneath her chair.<br> <br>The name tag on the nurse&#x2019;s uniform identified her as &#x201c;Ann Mackey, RN. Private Duty,&#x201d; Leigh noted as she watched the nurse pouring water from a pink plastic pitcher on the tray beside the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;You should have a straw. I&#x2019;ll go get one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t bother. I&#x2019;m terribly thirsty.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the nurse started to hold the glass to Leigh&#x2019;s mouth, Leigh took it from her. &#x201c;I can hold it,&#x201d; Leigh assured her, and then was amazed by how much effort it took just to lift her bandaged arm and hold it steady. By the time she handed the glass back to Nurse Mackey, her arm was trembling and her chest hurt terribly. Wondering if perhaps there was more wrong with her than she&#x2019;d thought, Leigh let her head sink back into the pillows while she gathered the strength to talk. &#x201c;What sort of condition am I in?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nurse Mackey looked eager to share her knowledge, but she hesitated. &#x201c;You really should ask Dr. Metcalf about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will, but I&#x2019;d like to hear it now, from my private duty nurse. I won&#x2019;t tell him you told me anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was all the encouragement she needed. &#x201c;You were in shock when you were brought in,&#x201d; she confided. &#x201c;You had a concussion, hypothermia, cracked ribs, and suspected injuries to the cervical vertebrae and adjacent tissue&#x2014;that&#x2019;s whiplash in layman&#x2019;s terms. You have several deep scalp wounds, as well as lacerations on your arms, legs, and torso, but only a few of them are on your face, and they aren&#x2019;t deep, which is a blessing. You also have contusions and abrasions all over your&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Smiling as much as her swollen lip would allow, Leigh lifted her hand to stop the litany of injuries. &#x201c;Is there anything wrong with me that will need surgery?&#x201d;<br> <br>The nurse looked taken aback by Leigh&#x2019;s upbeat attitude, and then she looked impressed. &#x201c;No surgery,&#x201d; she said with an approving little pat on Leigh&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any physical therapy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t think so. But you should expect to be very sore for a few weeks, and your ribs will hurt. Your burns and cuts will require close attention, healing and scarring could be a concern&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Leigh interrupted this new deluge of depressing medical minutiae with a grin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be very careful,&#x201d; she said, and then she switched to the only other topic on her mind. &#x201c;Where is my husband?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nurse Mackey faltered and then patted Leigh&#x2019;s shoulder again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go and see about that,&#x201d; she promised, and hurried off, leaving Leigh with the impression that Logan was nearby.<br> <br>Exhausted from the simple acts of drinking and speaking, Leigh closed her eyes and tried to piece together what had happened to her since yesterday, when Logan had kissed her good-bye in the morning. . . .<br> <br>He&#x2019;d been so excited when he left their Upper East Side apartment, so eager for her to join him in the mountains and spend the night with him there. For over a year, he&#x2019;d been looking for just the right site for their mountain retreat, a secluded setting that would complement the sprawling stone house he&#x2019;d designed for the two of them. Finding the right site was complicated by the fact that Logan had already completed the drawings, so the site needed to be adaptable to the plans. On Thursday, he&#x2019;d finally found a piece of property that met all his exacting qualifications, and he&#x2019;d been so eager for her to see it that he insisted they should spend Sunday night&#x2014;their first available night&#x2014;in the existing cabin on the land.<br> <br>&#x201c;The cabin hasn&#x2019;t been used in years, but I&#x2019;ll clean it up while I&#x2019;m waiting for you to get there,&#x201d; he promised, displaying an endearing enthusiasm for a task he&#x2019;d always avoided. &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t any electricity or heat, but I&#x2019;ll build a roaring fire in the fireplace, and we&#x2019;ll sleep in front of it in sleeping bags. We&#x2019;ll have dinner by candlelight. In the morning, we&#x2019;ll watch the sun rise over the tops of the trees. Our trees. It will be very romantic, you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br> <br>His entire plan filled Leigh with amused dread. She was starring in a new play that had opened on Broadway the night before, and she&#x2019;d only had four hours of sleep. Before she could leave for the mountains, she had a Sunday matinee performance to give, and that would be followed by a three-hour drive to a cold, uninhabitable stone cabin, so that she could sleep on the floor . . . and then get up at dawn the next day.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait,&#x201d; she lied convincingly, but what she really wanted to do was go back to sleep. It was only eight o&#x2019;clock. She could sleep until ten.<br> <br>Logan hadn&#x2019;t had any more sleep than she, but he was already dressed and eager to leave for the cabin. &#x201c;The place isn&#x2019;t easy to find, so I drew you a detailed map with plenty of landmarks,&#x201d; he said, laying a piece of paper on her nightstand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already loaded the car. I think I have everything I need&#x2014;&#x201d; he continued, leaning over her in bed and pressing a quick kiss on her cheek, &#x201c;&#x2014;house plans, stakes, string, a transom, sleeping bags. I still feel like I&#x2019;m forgetting something . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A broom, a mop, and a bucket?&#x201d; Leigh joked sleepily as she rolled over onto her stomach. &#x201c;Scrub brushes? Detergent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Killjoy,&#x201d; he teased, nuzzling her neck where he knew she was ticklish.<br> <br>Leigh giggled, pulled the pillow over the back of her head, and continued dictating his shopping list. &#x201c;Disinfectant . . . mousetraps . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sound like a spoiled, pampered Broadway star,&#x201d; he chuckled, pressing down on the pillow to prevent her from adding more items to the list. &#x201c;Where is your sense of adventure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It stops at a Holiday Inn,&#x201d; she said with a muffled giggle.<br> <br>&#x201c;You used to love to go camping. You were the one who taught me how. You even suggested we go camping on our honeymoon!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because we couldn&#x2019;t afford a Holiday Inn.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a laugh, he pulled the pillow away from her head and rumpled her hair. &#x201c;Leave straight from the theater. Don&#x2019;t be late.&#x201d; He stood up and headed for the door to their bedroom suite. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m forgetting something&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Drinking water, candles, a tin coffeepot?&#x201d; Leigh helpfully chanted. &#x201c;Food for dinner? A pear for my breakfast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No more pears. You&#x2019;re addicted,&#x201d; he teased over his shoulder. &#x201c;From now on, it&#x2019;s Cream of Wheat and prunes for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadist,&#x201d; Leigh mumbled into the pillows. A moment later she heard the door close behind him, and she rolled onto her back, smiling to herself as she gazed out the bedroom windows overlooking Central Park. Logan&#x2019;s enthusiasm for the mountain property was contagious, but his lighthearted mood was what mattered most to her. They&#x2019;d both been so young, and so poor, when they got married thirteen years ago that hard work had been a necessity, and then it had become a habit. On their wedding day, their total combined assets were eight hundred dollars in cash, plus Logan&#x2019;s new architectural degree, his mother&#x2019;s social connections, and Leigh&#x2019;s unproven acting talent&#x2014;that, and their unflagging faith in each other. With only those tools, they&#x2019;d built a wonderful life together, but during the last few months, they&#x2019;d both been so busy that their sex life had been almost nonexistent. She&#x2019;d been immersed in the preopening craziness of a new play, and Logan had been consumed with the endless complexities of his latest, and biggest, business venture.<br> <br>As Leigh lay in bed, gazing out at the clouds gathering in the November sky, she decided she definitely liked the prospect of spending the night in front of a roaring fire with nothing to do but make love with her husband. They wanted a baby, and she suddenly realized that even the timing was right for conception tonight. She was dreamily imagining the evening that lay ahead when Hilda walked into the bedroom wearing her coat and carrying Leigh&#x2019;s breakfast tray. &#x201c;Mr. Manning said you were awake, so I brought you breakfast before I leave,&#x201d; Hilda explained. She waited while Leigh struggled into a sitting position; then she handed her the tray containing Leigh&#x2019;s ritual breakfast fare&#x2014;cottage cheese, a pear, and coffee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tidied up after the party. Is there anything else you&#x2019;d like me to do before I go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a thing. Enjoy your day off. Are you planning to stay in New Jersey at your sister&#x2019;s tonight?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hilda nodded. &#x201c;My sister said she&#x2019;s had very good luck at Harrah&#x2019;s lately. I thought we might go there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leigh suppressed a grin because, as far as she&#x2019;d been able to tell, Hilda had absolutely no human weaknesses&#x2014;except one for the nickel slot machines in Atlantic City. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be back here until late tomorrow afternoon,&#x201d; Leigh said as a thought occurred to her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to go straight to the theater, and Mr. Manning has a dinner meeting that will last until late in the evening. There&#x2019;s really no need for you to be here tomorrow night. Why don&#x2019;t you spend two days with your sister, and check out some of the slot machines at the other casinos?&#x201d;<br> <br>The suggestion of two consecutive days off threw the housekeeper into a total state of inner conflict that reflected itself on Hilda&#x2019;s plain face and made Leigh stifle another grin. In the War Against Dirt and Disorder, Hilda Brunner was a militant, tireless general who marched into daily battle armed with a vacuum cleaner and cleaning supplies, her foreboding expression warning of an impending assault on all foreign particles. To Hilda, taking two days off in a row was tantamount to a voluntary retreat, and that was virtually unthinkable. On the other hand, if she did as Leigh suggested, she would be able to spend two full days with her sister at the nickel slot machines. She cast a glance around the immaculate bedroom that was her personal battlefield, trying to assess in advance the extent of damage likely to occur if she were absent for two entire days. &#x201c;I would like to think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Leigh said, struggling to keep her face straight. &#x201c;Hilda,&#x201d; she called as the German woman bustled toward the door.<br> <br>Hilda turned in the act of belting her brown coat around her waist. &#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Manning?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a treasure.&#x201d;<br> <br>LEIGH HAD HOPED to leave the theater by four o&#x2019;clock that afternoon, but the play&#x2019;s director and the writer wanted to make some minor changes in two of her scenes after watching the matinee performance, and then they argued endlessly over which changes to make, trying out first one variation, then another. As a result, it was after six when she was finally on her way.<br> <br>Patchy fog mixed with light snow slowed her progress out of the city. Leigh tried to call Logan twice on his cellular phone to tell him she was going to be late, but either he&#x2019;d left his phone somewhere out of hearing or the cabin was beyond range of his cellular service. She left voice mail messages for him instead.<br> <br>By the time she reached the mountains, the snow was falling hard and fast, and the wind had picked up dramatically. Leigh&#x2019;s Mercedes sedan was heavy and handled well, but the driving was treacherous, the visibility so poor that she could only see fifteen feet in front of her car. At times it was impossible to see large road signs, let alone spot the little landmarks Logan had noted on his map. Roadside restaurants and gas stations that would normally have been open at ten P.M. were closed, their parking lots deserted. Twice, she doubled back, certain she&#x2019;d missed a landmark or a road. With nowhere to stop or ask for directions, Leigh had little choice except to keep driving and searching.<br> <br>When she should have been within a few miles of the cabin, she turned into an unmarked driveway with a fence across it and switched on the car&#x2019;s map light to study Logan&#x2019;s directions again. She was almost positive she&#x2019;d missed a turnoff two miles back, the one Logan had described as being &#x201c;200 feet south of a sharp curve in the road, just beyond a little red barn.&#x201d; With at least six inches of snow blanketing everything, what had seemed like a little barn to her could just as easily have been a large black shed, a short silo, or a pile of frozen cows, but Leigh decided she should go back and find out.<br> <br>She put the Mercedes into gear and made a cautious U-turn. As she rounded the sharp curve she was looking for, she slowed down even more, searching for a gravel drive, but the drop-off was much too steep, the terrain far too rugged, for anyone to have put a driveway there. She&#x2019;d just taken her foot off the brake and started to accelerate when a pair of headlights on high beam leapt out of the darkness behind...</p><h2>In a Dark Wood: The Fight over Forests and the Rising Tyranny of Ecology</h2><p>Depicting the battle to save the old-growth forests of the Northwest, a book documenting the car bombing of an environmental activist and buyout of the Pacific Lumber Company explores the origins of the conflict from various points of view.</p><p>Chase begins by tracing the swath of logging from east to west, the efforts of silviculturists to achieve timber sustainability, and the evolution of ideas that have led to the "teleological myth" of ecology. Next he recounts the attempts by ecologists, principally Earth First!ers, to block logging in the Northwest, initially to preserve old-growth forests. In addition to finding biocentric beliefs offensive, Chase also appears to find the Earth First!ers' lifestyles as nasty as their terrorist tactics, and the narrative devolves into irrelevant tattle and ridicule. Perhaps because of this antipathy, he is persuasive in his sympathetic depiction of the plight of the logging community. Chase's pro-forestry contribution to the ongoing controversy of whether habitat preservation is essential, nonessential, or detrimental to species survival is also effective, and examples are provided of some deleterious consequences of preservation, such as the nationwide overabundance of deer. <i>Brenda Grazis</i></p><h2>In My Brother&#39;s Shadow: A Life and Death in the SS</h2><p><b>A renowned German novelist's memoir of his brother, who joined the SS and was killed at the Russian front. </b><br><br>Uwe Timm was only two years old when in 1942 his older brother, Karl Heinz, announced to his family he had volunteered for service with an elite squadron of the German army, the SS Totenkopf Division, also known as Death's Heads. Little more than a year later Karl Heinz was injured in battle at the Russian front, his legs amputated, and a few weeks after that he died in a military hospital. To their father, Karl Heinz's death only served to immortalize him as the courageous one, the obedient one, the one who upheld the family honor. His childhood was marked by the mythology of his brother's lost life; his absence-the hole he left in the family-just as palpable as if he were still alive. His mother's sadness and his father's rage over the loss of Karl Heinz ultimately defined Uwe's relationship with his parents. But while they eulogized the boy, Uwe wondered: who really had his brother been? <br><br>The life and death of his older brother has haunted Uwe Timm for more than sixty years. His parents' silence was one of the most painful aspects of his family history. Not even after the war ended, and details of unspeakable horrors emerged, did his parents ever acknowledge Germany's guilt and Karl Heinz's role in it. They simply said: We didn't know. After the deaths of his parents and older sister Timm set out in search of answers. Using military reports, letters, family photos and cryptic entries from a diary his brother kept during the war, he began to piece together the picture, discovering his brother's story is not just that of one man, but the tragedy of an entire generation. <i> In the Shadow of My Brother</i> is a meditation on German history and guilt, one that is both nuanced and measured. <br></p><p>Uwe Timm was born 1940 in Hamburg. He studied German literature and philosophy in Munich and Paris. In 1972-1982 he was co-editor of the <i>Authors Edition</i>. He is the author of M<i>idsummer Night</i> and <i>The Invention of Curried Sausage</i>. He lives in Munich and Berlin.<br>"With piercing intelligence, . . . history and private life [are] interfused utterly by a master writer in a way at once authentic, unpretentious, moving, and of extraordinary significance." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"This masterful book is autobiographical. It delves into the lives of the author's family, father, mother and sister, during the Nazi years and the Second World War. But essentially it is about his older brother who joined the SS, the Storm Troopers with the skull and bones on their black uniforms. It does not take long, however, before the young man is sent to war and killed on the eastern front.<br><br>Up to this point the story is among thousands. What makes it unique and a bestseller in its original German version is the narrator's painstaking reconstruction of this life on the basis of a few letters, a few diary entries, a few photographs and his own desperate memories. On such scanty evidence he probes into the family dynamics, the movitves for his brother's involvements with the most aggressive of Nazi organizations and the signs of his early disenchantment. Deeply affecting are the narrator's speculations about his own vulnerabilities and his hypothetical attitudes towards the regime, had he been old enough to be confronted with any decisions, questions all Germans, nay, all persons living in a country with an army should ask themselves." --Egon Schwarz, Distinguished Professor in the Humanities, Washington University<br></p><h2>All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues</h2><p>(Book).

I was asleep and I liked the noise, as though it were part of a sad but hopeful dream. But then it became less a part of the dream and more the thing that was waking me up.</p><p>I sat up in bed and tried to gather my weary senses. I was home. Cliff wasn&#x2019;t with me. Why? I remembered&#x2014;he was in St. Louis picking up some equipment. He should be back tomorrow, or was that later today?</p><p>The train whistle sounded again, its volume much louder and its pitch high enough that it would surely hurt my ears if I was standing close to it.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t live anywhere near train tracks.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Not true,&#x201d; I said aloud with a sleep-cragged voice.</p><p>Clumsily, I rolled out of bed. I pulled a shirt and some shorts out of my dresser and threw them on over my nightshirt. I grabbed my phone, noticing that it was 3:04 in the morning, and hurried through and then out of the house, stopping short when I got to my small front porch.</p><p>My house was located on a dead-end street; the dead-end part, the spot where now there was just an open field of neglected grass, was once home to the Broken Rope train station. In its heyday and before Route 66 was<i> the</i> Route 66, this spot of Missouri saw lots of train traffic, and the area where my house was now located had been a thoroughfare, busy with travelers coming and going. I wasn&#x2019;t old enough to have any memories of the station, of course, but my best friend and the town historian, Jake, had shown me pictures. Black and white renditions of women in tight-waisted long dresses and hats that made my neck ache just by looking at them, and men in heavy suits and ties posing in front of oily black engines that spat out white clouds of steam. There weren&#x2019;t many smiles in those pictures. I liked to tease Jake that it was because those posing for the pictures were so miserable in their heavy, tight, and itchy clothing. He insisted that it was because back then everyone had such lousy teeth.</p><p>The field was five houses away, and currently no longer a field. Well, it probably still was a field, but I was seeing it differently. I was seeing it as it was back during the late 1800s when those long skirts and thick suits were all the rage, and back when people dressed up when they traveled.</p><p>I was both concerned and fascinated, but more intrigued than anything else. I knew what was going on and it wasn&#x2019;t an unusual occurence&#x2014;for me, as well as for my gram, Missouri Anna Winston. I&#x2019;d become used to seeing and communicating with ghosts from Broken Rope&#x2019;s past, so I knew the scene being played out at the end of the street was something that would contain at least one specter searching for attention from someone still alive. Mostly, my and my grandmother&#x2019;s ghosts were pretty harmless, but there were moments when the danger they brought with them was real and present-day, and potentially deadly.</p><p>I stepped slowly and carefully down the porch steps, pausing again at the bottom. The train I&#x2019;d heard approaching the station came into view nose-first, its squeaky brakes and loud whistle announcing that it was about to stop completely. I sniffed deeply and found a scent&#x2014;flowers, a big, assorted bouquet of flowers. Or was that a neighbor&#x2019;s garden? I couldn&#x2019;t be totally sure, but the scent was so strong, so pure, that I thought that it was most likely attached to a visiting ghost.</p><p>The station platform was on the other side of the slowing train, so my view of whatever was going on there was about to be blocked. I looked around, confirmed that no one was watching me or peering through their windows, and then hurried down the street. I stepped in front of the now stationary locomotive and over the seemingly very real train tracks. Those few steps transported me almost fully into the past. Different than some time I&#x2019;d spent in an old bakery, I could still see my house and neighborhood in their present-day state, though all the houses, streetlights, and cars were dim and murky and much less real than the feel of the wood planks shifting with my weight as I moved onto the platform.</p><p>The station was a long, wide, one-story building that ran along the back of the platform, made of what looked like the same pinewood planks under my feet. There were two doors in its middle, both currently open wide. To the right of the doors was a small window where I assumed long-ago tickets had been purchased. I stepped toward the doors and peered inside. There were two more ticket booths along one wall. The rest of the space was filled with rows of benches, also made of the same pinewood. The handiwork on the benches was much more utilitarian than I might have pictured it to be. Perhaps it was the movies of my time that made me think of curved, ornate arms and slanted backs, but these benches were simple, straight-backed seats that must have offered respite to only the weariest of travelers. The row of windows along the back wall seemed odd in a couple of ways. Daylight streamed through them, and they were made of glass and what looked like fancy wrought-iron frames. They looked almost elegant against the light pine everywhere. The contrast of the thick Missouri woods bathed in bright sunlight on the other side of the windows made me wonder why and when all the trees had been razed to make way for the present-day vacant grass field that now extended at least a hundred yards back.</p><p>As I turned toward the train, more images began to appear. With faded beginnings, people quickly formed and solidified, becoming dimensional and bathed in the same long-ago sunlight that lit the trees.</p><p>&#x201c;But, Papa, I&#x2019;m so very hungry,&#x201d; a small girl with black curls and big green eyes said to a man with matching features who held her hand tightly.</p><p>&#x201c;I know, Mary, but we&#x2019;ll spoil our dinner if we eat the peanuts right now. Save them. Grandmama will have dinner on the table when we get there. Don&#x2019;t ask me again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said with a sigh of disappointment.</p><p>With her bottom lip stuck out, she looked up at me. I smiled and waved, but she didn&#x2019;t respond, didn&#x2019;t even blink. Did she not see me?</p><p>An older gentleman who was still spry enough to be moving at a quick clip had his eyes on the pocket watch he held as he beelined directly toward me. I stepped to the side, but not quickly enough to avoid him completely. His left arm went right through me. I felt nothing, but it was one of those weird ghost things that I would probably never get used to.</p><p>It seemed that none of these ghosts saw me, which was a first. Usually, if there was a ghost in the general vicinity, they could see and communicate with both me and Gram. It was what I thought &#x201c;this&#x201d; was all about&#x2014;we could see and talk to them because they could see and talk to us. But the ghost rules had already proved to be fluid, changing at least a little bit with each new ghostly guest.</p><p>I wondered what was going on, but didn&#x2019;t sense any danger. I decided I could either go home and go back to bed or stay and wait for whatever happened next, discover if anyone would &#x201c;see&#x201d; me eventually.</p><p>So many ghosts materialized that the platform became crowded. Even though I could not feel anyone&#x2019;s touch or any sort of breeze their movements stirred up, I became uncomfortable and a little claustrophobic. No one was dodging me, and it was impossible for me to dodge everyone else, so I wove my way to a spot close to the building&#x2019;s doors and out of the main streams of traffic. I heard their voices as they hurried to purchase tickets and sped toward the train or from it and toward whoever was greeting them. I saw their faces and expressions clearly, but still no one saw me.</p><p>My fascination with this step back into another time wore thinner with each passing moment. It was late and I did have to get up early the next morning. Perhaps I could ignore all the noise that I was almost a hundred percent sure I&#x2019;d still hear from my house and catch a few more hours&#x2019; sleep. But just as I made that decision, something changed.</p><p>The scent of flowers grew stronger, filling my nose so fully that a small twinge of sinus pain shot through my head. It mellowed quickly, becoming lighter and pleasant.</p><p>A ghost came through the doors, stepping from the inside of the station to the outside platform. She was stunning; the kind of beautiful that made it almost impossible to look away from her. I wanted to study her, see the specifics of her appeal. Since I didn&#x2019;t think she could see me, I figured I could stare all I wanted.</p><p>She was tall and small-waisted&#x2014;probably from a tight corset&#x2014;she was curvy enough not to be called skinny, but thin enough not to be called chubby. Her neck was long and swanlike. Her dark skin was smooth and flawless and she had high, delicate cheeks. Her nose was button, but for some reason it fit well with her grown-up features. The sadness in her brown eyes was so palpable that when they pooled with tears my heart ached sympathetically.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; I said quietly.</p><p>She looked at me, blinked back the tears and then opened her eyes wide. &#x201c;Oh my, dear, where are your clothes? Here, let me give you my coat.&#x201d; She made a move to unbutton the thin outer layer that looked like it was part of her dress.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said as I looked at myself. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m fine, thank you anyway. You can hear me? See me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, silly thing, but what are you doing without so much as some good underpinnings on?&#x201d;</p><p>As she continued to unbutton, the scene changed again. Suddenly, it was just she and I on the platform. The steam engine remained and puttered in the background. All the other ghosts disappeared.</p><p>She looked up and around and then at me. &#x201c;Gracious, this is odd. Where did everyone go?&#x201d; She stopped unbuttoning and took a large step toward the locomotive. Her fingers moved to a simple chain around her neck.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m Betts, Isabelle Winston,&#x201d; I said as I stepped next to her. &#x201c;This is all strange because it&#x2019;s not part of what is happening in present time. My grandmother is Missouri Anna Winston. Perhaps you know her?&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at me and blinked. &#x201c;I do not know your grandmother and I don&#x2019;t quite understand what you mean. At all.&#x201d;</p><p>Since the ghosts&#x2019; memories were sometimes scrambled when they first arrived, it could take time for them to acclimate, but if this was this ghost&#x2019;s first visit it would also be my first visit without Gram to help me through the introductions. I thought about one of our previous experiences.</p><p>&#x201c;May I ask your name?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Grace,&#x201d; she said absently as she searched the platform.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Grace, this is bound to be strange, but you are currently visiting the twenty-first century. This scene,&#x201d; I waved my arm, &#x201c;is something from the past.&#x201d; I swallowed hard before I said the next part because it seemed so cruel, but Gram had told me that there was no need to be delicate. The ghosts&#x2019; realization that they were no longer a part of the living world couldn&#x2019;t possibly harm them, and the sooner they knew the truth the better it was for them, and for her and me.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you tell me what you think the date is?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s August 16, 1888.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, it isn&#x2019;t. You died long ago, Grace. You&#x2019;re just back visiting Broken Rope, a long time after you lived. My Gram and I are the only ones you will be able to communicate with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. I&#x2019;m in Broken Rope?&#x201d;</p><p>I was surprised that this was the most curious part of what I&#x2019;d just told her, but I said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I made it then, I made it,&#x201d; she said as she stepped back, turned and looked around. &#x201c;Is he here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Robert. Is he here?&#x201d; She continued to search.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anyone else around,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There were other people here a few minutes ago, but I don&#x2019;t know who Robert is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, oh no. This isn&#x2019;t right,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;What isn&#x2019;t right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is not the Broken Rope station,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>I felt words of protest rise in my throat&#x2014;how could this be another station? We were in Broken Rope. But then I realized she might be right. I stepped away from the building and looked around. I thought about the pictures Jake had shown me, and though the people in their interesting clothing and the oily black locomotive were parts of what I had seen, the station building I was currently looking at was not. In the pictures, the building had been diminished, a part of the backdrop, but I knew it had not been an uninteresting one-story made of simple, boring pine planks. In fact, I remembered that at one time Jake had gone on and on about the station building and how it had been an attraction in itself, how it was something he wished could be rebuilt for the tourists to see and experience. I tried hard to remember the building details, but I just hadn&#x2019;t found it as interesting as the people and the trains.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; I asked Grace as I peered out toward my house. It was still there in the murky distance. I was relieved.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at the building, searching for a name, a town, a signpost of some sort. There was nothing. In fact, there were no words anywhere.</p><p>&#x201c;Grace,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;who is Robert?&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked and then turned her confused attention toward me. &#x201c;Robert Findlay was the man I was supposed to marry. I was to meet him in Broken Rope, and we were going to run away together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Run away?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why did you need to run away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We had to find a place we would be accepted. I&#x2019;m from Mississippi, Robert was from Broken Rope. We were going to go north, perhaps as far north as we could go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Accepted?&#x201d; I said, but then I thought I understood what she was getting at.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Of course, a white man marrying a negro woman is not welcome in many parts.&#x201d;</p><p>I cringed at the word <i>negro</i>, but I had to remember that in 1888 that word wasn&#x2019;t unsettling or racist, and an interracial marriage most definitely wouldn&#x2019;t have been welcomed back then, or, sadly, for some time afterward.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think you didn&#x2019;t make it to Broken Rope?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Grace fell into thought and I was once again taken aback by her beauty. She was not pretty in a youthful way, but in a wise and strong but slightly sad way. It would be easy to see how men, and women too, of all different colors would have found their eyes drawn to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Wait, I do think I made it to Broken Rope.&#x201d; She glanced at the building, her eyebrows coming together. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what or where this station is, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your station, from Mississippi maybe? Was this the beginning of your trip?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I really don&#x2019;t think so. I don&#x2019;t remember the station from Mississippi, but something tells me this isn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d; She paused, stared blankly at the planks of the platform, and then looked back at me. &#x201c;Something terrible happened to me, I&#x2019;m almost sure. Do you know what that was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t. Try to remember some specifics,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>A long few beats later, she said, &#x201c;I was killed, murdered, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Grace,&#x201d; I said as I stepped closer to her. I reached for her hand, glad it was solid. &#x201c;Listen to me, you can&#x2019;t die twice. You&#x2019;re probably getting a bunch of jumbled memories coming at you at once, and that&#x2019;s normal, I promise. But...</p></p><h2>The Shadow King: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A gripping novel set during Mussolini&#x2019;s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia, <em>The Shadow King</em> takes us back to the first real conflict of World War II, casting light on the women soldiers who were left out of the historical record.</strong></p><p>With the threat of Mussolini&#x2019;s army looming, recently orphaned Hirut struggles to adapt to her new life as a maid in Kidane and his wife Aster&#x2019;s household. Kidane, an officer in Emperor Haile Selassie&#x2019;s army, rushes to mobilize his strongest men before the Italians invade. His initial kindness to Hirut shifts into a flinty cruelty when she resists his advances, and Hirut finds herself tumbling into a new world of thefts and violations, of betrayals and overwhelming rage. Meanwhile, Mussolini&#x2019;s technologically advanced army prepares for an easy victory. Hundreds of thousands of Italians&#x2015;Jewish photographer Ettore among them&#x2015;march on Ethiopia seeking adventure.</p><p>As the war begins in earnest, Hirut, Aster, and the other women long to do more than care for the wounded and bury the dead. When Emperor Haile Selassie goes into exile and Ethiopia quickly loses hope, it is Hirut who offers a plan to maintain morale. She helps disguise a gentle peasant as the emperor and soon becomes his guard, inspiring other women to take up arms against the Italians. But how could she have predicted her own personal war as a prisoner of one of Italy&#x2019;s most vicious officers, who will force her to pose before Ettore&#x2019;s camera?</p><p>What follows is a gorgeously crafted and unputdownable exploration of female power, with Hirut as the fierce, original, and brilliant voice at its heart. In incandescent, lyrical prose, Maaza Mengiste breathes life into complicated characters on both sides of the battle line, shaping a heartrending, indelible exploration of what it means to be a woman at war.</p></p><p>Maaza Mengiste was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A Fulbright Scholar and professor in the MFA in Creative Writing &amp; Literary Translation program at Queens College, she is the author of The Shadow King and Beneath the Lion&#x2019;s Gaze, named one of the Guardian&#x2019;s Ten Best Contemporary African Books. Her work can be found in The New Yorker, Granta, and the New York Times, among other publications. She lives in New York City.&#x201c;Mengiste again brings heart and authenticity to a slice of Ethiopian history...[She] breaks new ground in this evocative, mesmerizing account of the role of women during wartime&#x2015;not just as caregivers, but as warriors defending their country.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Monumental... Mengiste's extraordinary characters&#x2015;shrewd Kidane, militant Aster, the enigmatic cook, narcissistic Italian commander Fucelli, conflicted photographer Ettore, elusive prostitute Fifi, even haunted Selassie&#x2015;epitomize the impossibly intricate ties between humanity and monstrosity, and the unthinkable, immeasurable cost of survival.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating and tension-filled... Descriptions of the fog of battle are exquisite and horrific, all the more remarkable for being told from a woman's point of view. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mengiste is a master of characterization... A memorable portrait of a people at war&#x2015;a war that has long demanded recounting from an Ethiopian point of view.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant novel, lyrically lifting history towards myth. It&#x2019;s also compulsively readable. I devoured it in two days.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Salman Rushdie, author of <em>Quichotte</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Shadow King</em> is a beautiful and devastating work; of women holding together a world ripping itself apart. They will slip into your dreams and overtake your memories.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marlon James, author of <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With epic sweep and dignity, Mengiste has lifted this struggle into legend, along with the women who fought in it. Beautiful, horrifying, elegant, and haunted, <em>The Shadow King</em> is a modern classic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Sean Greer, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <em>Less</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Shadow King</em> is a novel about war and history, both epic in scope and intimate in detail...Maaza Mengiste has a gift for rendering everyone in this story, resister and invader alike, with great nuance and complexity, leaving us with no room for easy judgment. A wonderful book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Laila Lalami, author of <em>The Other Americans</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most affecting accounts of the terror of war I have ever read, all the more so for the being cloaked in the language of beauty, such that the words and their meaning burn through the senses. <em>The Shadow King</em> is a work borne of rage, a rage made magnificent for its compassion and the story it tells us&#x2015;that in war there are no winners.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Aminatta Forna, author of <em>Happiness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Maaza Mengiste has given us a powerful tale of a woman warrior&#x2015;not some mythical superhero, but a girl who holds on to the memory of her parents and her father&#x2019;s gun and longs to do battle to avenge their loss. Reminiscent of Maxine Hong Kingston&#x2019;s <em>Woman Warrior</em> and Marlon James&#x2019;s <em>The Book of Night Women</em>, this is a compelling story of female empowerment and an epic one at that.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mary Morris, author of <em>Gateway to the Moon</em></strong></p><h2>Big Picture</h2><p>The characters in Big Picture, Percival Everett's darkly comic collection of stories, are often driven to explosive, life-changing action. Everett delves into those moments when outside forces bring us to the brink of insanity or liberation.<br>The catalysts in Everett's tales are surprising: a stuffed boar's head, mounted on the wall of a diner, becomes an object of intense, inexplicable desire; a painter is driven to the point of suicide by a mute who returns day after day to mow the artist's lawn; the loss of a pair of dentures sparks a turn toward revelation.</p><p>From the author of <i>Zulus</i>, <i>Watershed</i>, and <i>For Her Dark Skin</i> comes <i>Big Picture</i>, a volume of short stories that deals with the quiet, almost unmarked instant where an off-the-cuff comment or a chance encounter alters lives in ways no one could have predicted. Typical is the pair of old friends whose relationship is transformed by the disappearance of a set of false teeth. Percival Everett's style is low-key and unassuming. It is not the flash of lightening, the peel of thunder, and the sudden downpour that swamps the lives of his characters that concerns him. Rather, it is the slow drip of time that finally wears a new path in landscape of their existence.Percival Everett is a professor of creative writing at the University of California, Riverside.</p><h2>Ultralight Boatbuilding</h2><p>Demonstrates each step in the construction of canoes and small boats, offers advice on tools, materials, and techniques, and explains how to expand naval architect drawings into full-scale plans</p><p><b>Tom Hill</b> lives in Huntington, in the Green Mountains of Vermont, where he has been building boats and houses since 1972.

Broad discussions of each tradition within the Gokaden focus on the features that distinguish specific schools and smiths-the various kinds of jihada, hamon, boshi, and hataraki favored in different periods and regions-making this an invaluable reference tool for all enthusiasts, especially those who wish to take part in kantei-kai, or sword appreciation meetings. Each section closes with an easy reference chart summarizing the distinctive features of the work of various schools and smiths.<br><br>The chapter on terminology gives advice on what to look for when examining the different parts of a blade, again making reference to the unique features of particularly significant smiths. The chapter on care and appraisal of blades tells precisely how to handle blades and what to expect at a sword appraisal meeting, including an explanation of all the various responses that a judge may give in response to a bid.<br><br>Richly illustrated throughout with more than 550 of the author's own painstaking oshigata illustrations-sword tracings onto which details are penciled in by hand-<em>The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords</em> is easily the most informative and comprehensive guide to the blades of Japanese swords ever to appear in English.<br><br>Kokan Nagayama, who is widely recognized as one of the foremost living sword polishers, compiled the notes for this book over the course of many years spent teaching the arts of polishing and appraisal.<br><br>Nagayama-sensei is widely recognized as one of the foremost living sword polishers and is a veteran teacher of both polishing and appraisal. Here in one accessible volume he distills the store of knowledge he has gained over a lifetime of intensive research.<br><br>"Nagayama-sensei and his senior pupils have for many years now taken an enlightened approach to study of Japanese swords outside of Japan. They have been of great assistance to collectors here in Great Britain and in other countries, traveling and living abroad, organizing exhibitions, teaching us and polishing our swords, always in an altruistic spirit. This translation is another example of this same approach. In the past we have often struggled on our own or in small groups to gain an understanding of this peculiarly Japanese cultural asset, and with many of the definitive books on the subject still untranslated, a wealth of information has in the past been inaccessible to the non-Japanese reader. The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords will be of great help in making educated judgments at kantei sessions, and will be an invaluable and constant reference work."<br>-From the Foreword by Clive Sinclaire<br>Chairman of the Token Society of Great Britain</p><p>"Nagayama-sensei and his senior pupils have for many years now taken an enlightened approach to study of Japanese swords outside of Japan.

He has been designated a mukansa ("without supervision") polisher, a level above the regular sword-polisher ranking system. He is a judge of both the sword polishing and swordsmithing competitions of the Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai or NBTHK (Society for the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords), for which organization he serves as an instructor of sword polishing. In 1967 in Kanagawa Prefecture he founded the Nagayama Kenshujo (Nagayama Japanese Sword-polishing Institute), where he taught the art of polishing to both polishers and smiths for twenty years. He has organized several token-kai (sword study groups) and instructed hundreds of sword enthusiasts.<br><br>KENJI MISHINA, the translator, is a sword polisher who served as chief instructor at the Nagayama Kenshujo for seven years beginning in 1979. He has been authorized by the Japanese government to restore swords designated as kokuho (national treasures) and juyo bunkazai (important cultural assets). He has been awarded numerous prizes in the sword polishing competitions of the NBTHK. He lived in England for six years beginning in 1986, where he worked for the British Museum, lectured at the monthly meetings of the Token Society of Great Britain, and received a request from the British royal family to polish its sword collection. He is currently writing a series of articles on the Japanese sword for this site. He is the translator of <em>The New Generation of Japanese Swordsmiths</em>.<br></p><h2>Early American southern homes: From material originally published as the White pine series of architectural monographs, edited by Russell F.

When real trouble arrives -- in the form of seven deadly giants roaming the countryside - Jack is blamed. "Bad attracts bad," the village preacher warns his frightened flock. Jack believes it, too. Worried that the village won't be safe unless he leaves, Jack sets off, never intending to battle the giants, but one by one, that's what happens. And in his surprising encounters with these seven truly bad seeds, Jack proves himself braver, smarter, and better than he ever suspected.<br><br>The author has found exactly the right youngster to defeat these overgrown manifestations of the seven traditional human failings (including Sloth, the would-be poet; the ever-incensed Mrs. Roth; and Avaritch, the greedy troglodyte), all of whom come roaring to life in striking pictures by Belgian Carll Cneut.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Sam Swope</b> is the author of three acclaimed picture books,<i> The Araboolies of Liberty Street, The Krazees, </i>and <i>Gotta Go!

That's the premise of 'Jack and the Seven Deadly Giants,' a freewheeling, irreverent story that can best be described as a slapstick fairy tale. Borrowing stock characters from traditional stories - a giant killer named Jack, a funny little man with magic beans, seven obsessed giants - Sam Swope, the author of the popular picture books 'Araboolies of Liberty Street,' 'The Krazees' and 'Gotta Go! Gotta Go!,' playfully reconfigures them to investigate the nature of fairy-tale vice...Carll Cneut's black-and-white illustrations humorously capture the grotesque repulsiveness and self-centeredness of each ogre. Swope plots his story cleverly so that before Jack can vanquish each giant, he must first tame or overcome a milder version of the same failing within himself. He gorges on pears before meeting up with the Terrible Glutton, falls into a rage at his innocent cow and briefly succumbs to greed and pride. The subtext of the story, which will sail past most children, seems to be what an absolutely gigantic space our emotions and weaknesses occupy in our psyches." -- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br></p><h2>Gifts And Ministries Of The Holy Spirit</h2><p>The gifts and ministries of the Holy Spirit function with greatest accuracy through people who understand them.

America had experienced a decade of horrifying assassinations; the unprecedented resignation of first a vice president and then a president of the United States; intense cultural and social change; and a new mood of cynicism sweeping the country&#x2014;a mood that, in some ways, lingers today.<br> <br>Into that divided atmosphere stepped an unexpected, unelected, and largely unknown American&#x2014;Gerald R. Ford. In contrast to every other individual who had ever occupied the Oval Office, he had never appeared on any ballot either for the presidency or the vice presidency; he had issued no policy statements nor had he ever run for national office. Now, he was being thrust into a chaotic environment in which our very future as a functioning democracy was being seriously questioned.<br> <br>Gerald Ford simply and humbly performed his duty to the best of his considerable ability. By the end of his 895 days as president, he would in fact have restored balance to our country, steadied the ship of state, and led his fellow Americans out of the national trauma of Watergate. And yet, Gerald Ford remains one of the least studied and least understood individuals to have held the office of the President of the United States. In turn, his legacy also remains severely underappreciated.<br> <br>In <i>When the Center Held</i>, Ford&#x2019;s Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld candidly shares his personal observations of the man himself, and provides a sweeping examination of his crucial years in office. It is a rare and fascinating look behind the closed doors of the Oval Office, including never-before-seen photos, memos, and anecdotes, from a unique insider&#x2019;s perspective&#x2014;essential reading for any fan of presidential history.</p><p>Donald Rumsfeld was the thirteenth and twenty-first United States Secretary of Defense. He currently chairs the Rumsfeld Foundation, which supports leadership and public service at home and the growth of free political and free economic systems abroad. He and his wife Joyce have three children, six grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.&#x201c;The presidency of Gerald R. Ford feels a world away--not simply in time, but in ethos. In this wonderful contribution to history, Donald Rumsfeld, who served President Ford as White House chief of staff and as secretary of Defense, gives a new generation an absorbing and important reflection on Ford and what the 38th president meant. The vital center in which Ford so deeply believed is facing an existential crisis in our own time, and Rumsfeld's book could not be more relevant or timely.&#x201d; Author: &#x2014;Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize-winning author<br><br>&#x201c;As a proud alumnus of the Ford Administration, I can attest that Don Rumsfeld&#x2019;s skillful and fascinating account of those critical years has done the President justice. &nbsp;This book, based on Don&#x2019;s real-time memos, is essential reading to anyone seeking to understand the American presidency, as Ford and his team rescued and remade it during unprecedented turmoil.&#x201d; Author: &#x2014;Dick Cheney, former Vice President<br><br>&#x201c;Gerald Ford is one of the most underrated presidents. He steadied the nation after Nixon and made peace in Vietnam. Donald Rumsfeld, who was Ford's chief of staff and secretary of defense, captures the essence of Ford and brings it home.&nbsp;<i>When the Center Held</i>&nbsp;is a magnificent book that should be read by every American.&#x201d; Author: &#x2014;Jean Edward Smith, bestselling author of BUSH</p><h2>War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America s Colony</h2><p>In 1950, after over fifty years of military occupation and colonial rule, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection against the United States. Violence swept through the island: assassins were sent to kill President Harry Truman, gunfights roared in eight towns, police stations and post offices were burned down. In order to suppress this uprising, the US Army deployed thousands of troops and bombarded two towns, marking the first time in history that the US government bombed its own citizens.<br><br>Nelson A. Denis tells this powerful story through the controversial life of Pedro Albizu Campos, who served as the president of the Nationalist Party. A lawyer, chemical engineer, and the first Puerto Rican to graduate from Harvard Law School, Albizu Campos was imprisoned for twenty-five years and died under mysterious circumstances. By tracing his life and death, Denis shows how the journey of Albizu Campos is part of a larger story of Puerto Rico and US colonialism.<br><br>Through oral histories, personal interviews, eyewitness accounts, congressional testimony, and recently declassified FBI files, <i>War Against All Puerto Ricans</i> tells the story of a forgotten revolution and its context in Puerto Rico's history, from the US invasion in 1898 to the modern-day struggle for self-determination. Denis provides an unflinching account of the gunfights, prison riots, political intrigue, FBI and CIA covert activity, and mass hysteria that accompanied this tumultuous period in Puerto Rican history.</p><p><b>Nelson A.

Denis immediately captures the reader's attention. His book is dramatic, panoramic, and it incites powerful emotions...This book must be read...in order to see the hidden face, the disagreeable reality of the US-Puerto Rico relationship, whose political and cultural consequences are today visible in a disoriented and demoralized nation, incapable of forging a dignified future." <b> Carmen Dolores Hern�ndez, <i>El Nuevo Dia</i></b><br><br>"[Nelson Denis] provides scathing insights into Washington's response to Albizu Campos's nationalist party and its violent revolution in 1950 that still has broad implications...his perspective of largely overlooked history could not be more timely." <b><i> New York Times</i></b><br><br>"<i>War Against All Puerto Ricans</i> was published...to supply the world with the hard truths about the small island's history. Like many other colonized places, specific details about Puerto Rico are swept under rugs and when revealed, they are watered down, whitewashed or, worse, omitted. Denis, however, is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent; his conviction for the island hits home...<i>War Against All Puerto Ricans</i>, in obvious wake of the island's economic turmoil, is relevant in understanding, full circle, why Puerto Rico is where it is today. The information to learn is hurtful, but eye opening in realizing that even in 2016, plantations still exist." <b><i> Vibe Magazine</i></b><br><br>"The writing is terrific...I found the footnotes and notes to be as fascinating and riveting as the narrative...Denis spent many years researching, reading, studying and analyzing, then has distilled a complicated history into a narrative that a general reader can understand and he's skillful in getting readers emotionally involved in the story." <b> Esmeralda Santiago, author of <i>When I was Puerto Rican</i></b><br><br>"In addition to a ton of data, the book presents photographs of the key events.

Indeed, this book is particularly urgent now. If this electoral season (for president, in the US; for governor, on the island) is to offer anything more than a contest of popular appeal and private funding, this book must play a role this is a history of which all candidates should be informed and a present question to which they all must respond." <b><i> Rain Taxi</i></b><br><br> A fascinating and vital work At a time when Pedro Albizu Campos and the Puerto Rican revolution have been all but buried by the establishment, this book can make a critical contribution to the cause of Puerto Rico.&#x201d; <b><i> Socialist Worker</i></b><br><br>"A pointed, relentless chronicle of a despicable part of past American foreign policy." <b><i> Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"A must-read...fascinating...This is not a novel, not a Hollywood script.

Turkey Unveiled is the only book in many years to attempt to fill a gap in perception with regard to this extremely complex country, and this paperback edition includes an epilogue that brings the book totally up to date, with coverage of the most recent developments in Turkey.<p>Throughout the last generation Turkey has opened up to the outside world, increasingly revealing a pluralistic and dynamic society. The authors, who speak fluent Turkish and have reported from Turkey for over a decade, provide a rich mosaic of contemporary Turkey and its formative past. The strengths and weaknesses of the Ottoman Empire, the Armenian tragedy, the ongoing Kurdish struggle, and the controversial legacy of the brilliant but autocratic founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, are all here. They also provide portraits of new leaders who have broken taboos and ushered in new freedoms at a time when other forces attempt to pull Turkey back into the MiddLe Eastern vortex. Hugh and Nicole Pope, combining analysis with understanding, make recent developments in Turkey intelligible for both the general reader and the millions of visitors welcomed by a burgeoning tourist industry.</p></p><p>Turkey, write journalists Nicole and Hugh Pope in this well-made narrative history, is a land that defies easy categorization, a melange of elements "European, Western, Eastern, Islamic, fascistic, anarchic" that has always been something of an enigma to outsiders. After decades of stagnation, it is now emerging as a nation of central importance in Eurasian geopolitics, as it was in the days of the Ottoman Empire. The authors describe the growth of the modern Turkish state in the aftermath of World War I, when that empire, defeated by the Allied powers, splintered into some 30 independent states. Led by Mustafa Kemal Atat�rk and his so-called Young Turks, the postwar state sought to curb the growth of Islamic fundamentalism, to introduce some measure of democracy into a formerly autocratic system, and to secure a place for Turkey in the constellation of world powers. They were only partly successful; Atat�rk, the authors contend, "led Turkey on the path of Westernization, but left it stranded half-way to full democratization because, deep down, he was not a democrat." Now, after years of military rule, the Turkish government is making efforts both to continue that democratization and to secure influence among the emerging Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. The nation, the authors write, is now the arena of conflict between left and right, fundamentalist and secularist, nationalist and cosmopolitan: it stands at a crossroads both political and historical. Westerners, they suggest, would do well to pay closer attention to Turkish affairs, and their book is a fine contribution toward that end. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Nicole Pope has worked for the Red Cross in Iraq and Lebanon and currently reports for Le Monde and international radio stations in Turkey.

Studies show that we can go only three minutes without air, perhaps three days without water, maybe three weeks without food. . . and but three hours without offering somebody our suggestions, responses, or critiques. A perennial &#34;hot&#34; topic in management circles is the process of giving, getting and analyzing advice. This brief and engaging book can be of use to anyone who has to interact with other people. You&#39;ll enjoy the &#34;read&#34; so much that you may not realize how much you have gained - all in words of one syllable! How to offer feedback when asked (or hired) to do so. Why feedback tells more about the giver than the receiver. How feedback is distorted or resisted by the receiver&#39;s point of view and defense mechanisms.

Eccentric enclaves and fantastic utopian experiments are multiplying. Once-secret fantasy gardens are cracking open their doors to outsiders. Our world is becoming stranger by the day&#x2014;and Alastair Bonnett observes and captures every fascinating change.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Beyond the Map</i>, Bonnett presents stories of the world&#x2019;s most extraordinary spaces&#x2014;many unmarked on any official map&#x2014;all of which challenge our assumptions about what we know&#x2014;or think we know&#x2014;about our world. As cultural, religious and political boundaries ebb and flow with each passing day, traditional maps unravel and fragment. With the same adventurous spirit he effused in the acclaimed <i>Unruly Places</i>, Bonnett takes us to thirty-nine incredible spots around the globe to explore these changing boundaries and stimulate our geographical imagination. Some are tied to disruptive contemporary political turbulence, such as the rise of ISIL, Russia&#x2019;s incursions into Ukraine and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom. Others explore the secret places not shown on Google Earth or reflect fast-changing landscapes.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Beyond the Map</i> journeys out into a world of mysterious, daunting and magical spaces. It is a world of hidden cultures and ghostly memories, of uncountable new islands and curious stabs at paradise. From the phantom tunnels of the Tokyo subway to a stunning movie-set re-creation of 1950s-era Moscow; from the caliphate of the Islamic State to virtual cybertopias&#x2014;<i>this book </i>serves as an imaginative guide to the farthest fringes of geography.</p><p><b>Alastair Bonnett </b>is professor of social geography at Newcastle University.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Bonnett&nbsp;has a flair for communicating his passion for 'the glee and the drama, the love and the loathing' that emanate from the earth&#x2019;s most perplexing and mutable places. . . .&nbsp;[His] provocative detours show us how much more we can know of the known world, if we know where to look, and how." (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;These essays about islands that appear and disappear with the tides, guerrilla gardeners planting on traffic circles, and clothing malfunctions in Second Life are entertaining as well as thought provoking. . . .

From the concept of guerrilla gardening in concrete jungles, trap streets on many maps, and the coastal tsunami stones planted decades or centuries ago in Japan . . . Bonnett fascinates with an exploration of the world beyond the map. Readers will want to take their time with each chapter, to peruse every new and often thought-provoking idea.

In urging us towards new intellectual vistas, Bonnett gives us a glimpse of what it might be like to question the fundamental boundaries and delineations of our ideas about space, politics, conflict, community, connection, and neighbors.

Childs rejects any approaches that overstress either the continuity or discontinuity between the Old and New Testaments. He refuses to follow the common pattern in Christian thought of identifying biblical theology with the New Testament&#39;s interest in the Old. Rather, Childs maps out an approach that reflects on the whole Christian Bible with its two very different voices, each of which retains continuing integrity and is heard on its own terms.</p><p>Brevard S.

She covers the tools required and gives a detailed description of materials. 116 full-color photos. 57 full-color diagrams.</p><p>Susie Vaughan lives in Gwent, South Wales, with her husband and three children. After leaving school, she trained and worked as a journalist on the South Wales Argus. She made her first basket with willow from a tree that had fallen across a local brook, following insructions in a magazine. Her basketmaking began as a hobby but she soon decided to specialise in hedgerow baskets, intruiged by the natural range of colour and texture. She now gives talks and demonstrations and her work has been exhibited at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and many regional galleries.July 09 This step-by-step guide describes how to make a selection of baskets using materials from hedgerows, woods and gardens. The author explains which materials are particularly suitable, and gives a comprehensive list of equipment. Excellent diagrams and photographs will help the novice produce a simple round basket, and a chapter on variation in design and weave will inspire further projects. Highly recommended. * Start * Summer 2015 This colourful and practical book was first published in 1994 and has just been reissued. If you are keen to try basketmaking using hedgerow and garden prunings, then this is an ideal introduction to a less conventional form of handweaving. The author first lists the basic tools you will need followed by an overview of the types of trees, shrubs and climbers which will yield suitable and attractive material, and when and how to to harvest and store it. The types of farmed willow available for purchase are also discussed. Following this detailed introduction, the constriction of a straightforward round basket is described in step-by-step detail, fully and clearly illustrated with line drawings and photographs. The technical terms used are explained and the method is easy to follow. Possible problems which may arise are explained and resolved in a number of text boxes. This basic construction method is developed in the following chapter for design variations such as oval and framed baskets. The addition of handles, lids and borders is described in detail, as well as the introduction of other possible weaving stroke. The text is completed with a gallery of beautiful and colourful baskets, made with all the more impressive by their humble constituent materials. The book is very well illustrated throughout and will certainly encourage and assist you in using otherwise waste garden material to very good effect. * Journal for Weavers, Spinners &amp; Dyers * February 2015 I will admit right now that I do have a weird passion for baskets. I don't know what it is - whether it's the natural materials, the lovely shapes and colours, the delightful creaking noise they make, but I am always absolutely thrilled if someone gives me a gift of, or in, a basket. So having acquired some basic willow-weaving skills, I was delighted to see this lovely book by Susie Vaughan and now feel inspired to have a go at making a basket myself. I haven't tried it yet, but it certainly makes my fingers itch. It is a 'how to' for beginners - half of the book tells you how to identify and collect the right material, and that's followed by the instructions to make a simple round basket, an oval basket, a frame basket, how to add handles, how to make interesting borders, how to make lids and then some inspirational pictures to get your creative juices going. It has made me want instantly to read for the sectors and start attacking the shrubs and tress in the garden for materials. Look out family, you could be getting very dodgy-looking baskety objects as presents this year. * The Onion Magazine * No. 170 June 2006 Search Press has republished this superb book. An easy to use, step-by-step guide to making baskets out of hedgerow materials. * Education Otherwise *</p><h2>Hirschfeld&#39;s Hollywood: The Film Art of Al Hirschfeld</h2><p>By the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences <p>"After all these many years, with nary a competitor in sight nor hindsight, Mr. Hirschfeld remains the master-the undisputed Chairman of the Drawing Board."<br>-Larry Gelbart </p><p>Al Hirschfeld's line drawings are synonymous with the American theater, but his dynamic work for Hollywood films is only now gaining the attention it deserves.

She was a Rockefeller Scholar, and received the American Psychological Association's Presidential Citation. Currently, she is a visiting professor in both the English and Psychology departments at the University of Nebraska.In this very personal writing guide, Pipher talks about the importance of point of view in writing, and she has a definite point of view here, tilting to the left: the world is in a bad way, and writers can serve as a "rescue team for our tired, overcrowded planet" by "tell[ing] stories that connect readers to all the people on earth." Pipher offers some good examples of how to accomplish this, particularly in a thoughtful and clever essay that presents the U.S. as a patient in a therapeutic case study ("Diagnosis: Post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple addictions"). And she offers useful advice in her sections on defining success (measured not in terms of sales but in terms of "giv[ing] our time and talents to help others") and revising, which she compares to pruning and weeding. There are dozens of pithy and inspiring quotes from a variety of writers, among them Woody Allen, Joan Didion and Eudora Welty. Those, along with Pipher's chipper you-can-do-it tone, will encourage idealistic aspiring writers, who will surely find inspiration in her assertion that writing can heal the world. <i>(Apr.)</i>Correction: Our review of Gary Schwartz's <i>The G.O.D.

We saw what the inevitable outcome of self-esteem would be from our immersion in the day-to-day work of helping parents raise children and teachers teach children who were lost in themselves, either self-conceited or self-conscious.<br> <br>Why did anyone ever think that raising children to believe in themselves, love themselves, and esteem themselves would lead to anything but narcissism?<br> <br>Jean Twenge, author of The Narcissism Epidemic, notes, &#x201c;In trying to build a society that celebrates high self-esteem, self-expression, and &#x2018;loving yourself,&#x2019; Americans have inadvertently created more narcissists&#x2014;and a culture that brings out the narcissistic behavior in all of us.&#x201d;2<br> <br>In this chapter, you will find there is a window of hope. If we raise the present generation to believe in others, love others, and esteem others, this generation can recover from the damage of self-esteem and lead a restoration of respect that can rebuild our society.<br> <br>WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, people weren&#x2019;t perfect, but society was certainly more civil. The line between right and wrong was clear. There was a sense of law and order.<br> <br>Teachers were teachers. So teachers taught.<br> <br>Parents were parents. So parents parented.<br> <br>Kids were kids. So kids obeyed.<br> <br>Respect for authority was paramount. Service to others and respect for property were natural elements of community. Teaching manners and instilling character were the cornerstones of public education. Parents looked at the right side of the report card (conduct) before they looked at the left (grades). Kids got in a lot more trouble if they were disrespectful to a teacher than if they made a B minus.<br> <br>Times past weren&#x2019;t perfect, but there certainly was an attitude of respectfulness that&#x2019;s now missing.<br> <br>Today we live in a society where:<br> <br>&#x2666;&nbsp;A high school valedictorian chose to use profanity in her graduation address, even in the presence of young children. And to make matters worse, her father supported her decision to &#x201c;stand her ground&#x201d; when she was asked to apologize and refused.<br> <br>&#x2666;&nbsp;Incessant texting takes place at the family dinner table, in classrooms, in boardrooms, while driving, and even during face-to-face conversations.<br> <br>&#x2666;&nbsp;Foul language is used in public, not only by males in the presence of females, but by females in the presence of males.<br> <br>I could fill this book with one example after another of disrespectful behavior. How did this happen? How did our respectful world become so disrespectful? We substituted self-esteem for self-respect, and in the process we lost our manners.<br> We Replaced Self-Respect with Self-Esteem<p></p> <br>MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO when I began visiting my twin sons&#x2019; school cafeteria to teach table manners, I had no concept that a volunteer project for a local school would grow into a full character education program that is now being used in schools and homes across the country. Since then, Manners of the Heart (a curriculum for schools) and Manners of the Heart at Home (a parents&#x2019; guide to the school curriculum) have been changing the lives of children, families, and communities.<br> <br>My experience of working with children and parents has convinced me that the troubles of today can be traced back to the early seventies, when a group of psychologists began theorizing why the rebellion of the sixties had taken place. Some experts concluded that the fifties were a time of such rigidity that teenagers who grew up in the &#x201c;era of rules&#x201d; were destined to revolt.<br> <br>The overwhelming majority of professionals, however, agreed that the reason teenagers rebelled was because of a deep need to be someone&#x2014;not just an American, but an individual. Not a member of a corporate body, but an individual making his or her own decisions based on personal beliefs, not the beliefs of parents or society. &#x201c;Believe in yourself&#x201d; became the mantra of the day.<br> <br>Specialists began telling parents the secret to raising healthy children was to build their self-esteem. Books on the subject of self-esteem skyrocketed to the top of bestseller lists, encouraging parents to be friends, not authority figures, with their kids. Discipline was out. Experts said that children needed to make their own decisions. Slowly but surely, children became the center of the universe.<br> <br>Parents today are still being told that the secret to raising healthy children is to build their self-esteem&#x2014;praise &#x2019;em in the morning, praise &#x2019;em at the noontime, praise &#x2019;em when the sun goes down. We&#x2019;ve been told to never deny our children anything and to stand against anyone who dares to correct our little ones&#x2014;all with the goal of helping our kids feel good about themselves.<br> <br>I received the following letter from parents who did all they were told to do in raising their fourteen-year-old son:<br> <br>He has very low self-esteem and very little motivation or desire to succeed in play or academics. We try to use positive reinforcement and praise him for completing projects or whatever we see him do well or put effort into. We make a point not to compare him to other children, but he tries hard to be like others (he really doesn&#x2019;t know what he likes or even who he is). He is in trouble at school almost every day for disrespect, and we know that he can do better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he just needs to know that he can, and he has to want to try to do better. Please help! Any suggestions?<br> <br>These parents had followed the advice of the day. But rather than help their son, they had unwittingly hurt him.<br> <br>One of my favorite no-nonsense parenting experts, John Rosemond, agrees that by emphasizing self-esteem, we&#x2019;ve lost something of great value:<br> <br>Character development has been de-emphasized and psychological development has become the focus. As this babble rose to a din, our collective perceptions of children began to change. We began to view them not as fairly durable little people who needed to be taught respect, responsibility, good manners, and the like, but as fragile little containers of something called self-esteem, which could be irreparably damaged with a harsh word.3<br> <br>As a result of this emphasis on self-esteem, twenty-somethings are returning home rather than facing the world on their own. College kids are flunking out because they don&#x2019;t know how to manage their schedules. Kids are growing up without problem-solving skills because their parents think love means solving all their problems for them. Many adolescents have no respect for authority because their parents didn&#x2019;t command their respect. Instead, these parents gave too much and expected too little.<br> <br>In our attempt to build self-esteem in children, we have reared a generation of young people who are failing at life, haven&#x2019;t a clue who they are, and are struggling to find a reason for living. These kids fall for the latest craze, healthy or unhealthy. It doesn&#x2019;t matter, as long as they&#x2019;re in the middle of it. They would rather die than give up their cell phones. And they feel that others have an obligation to serve them.<br> <br>Roy F. Baumeister, professor of psychology at Florida State University, was a proponent of self-esteem in the early seventies but has since changed his views. Forty years later, Baumeister now recommends, &#x201c;Forget about self-esteem and concentrate more on self-control and self-discipline. Recent work suggests this would be good for the individual and good for society&#x2014;and might even be able to fill some of those promises that self-esteem once made but could not keep.&#x201d;4 I agree. Rather than seeking to build self-esteem in our children, we need to focus on building self-control and self-discipline, which will develop self-respect.<br> <br>Many people use the words self-esteem and self-respect synonymously, but I believe the two are worlds apart. When we seek to help kids feel good about themselves (the goal of self-esteem), we teach them to focus on themselves and how they feel and what they want. I believe this perspective keeps children from participating in the world; it encourages them to see everything as if looking into a mirror, so they grow up believing &#x201c;it&#x2019;s all about me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kids raised with a focus on self-esteem have an unbalanced view of the world. They live by the motto &#x201c;I want it, and I want it now.&#x201d; Kids with this attitude aren&#x2019;t exhibiting self-confidence. They are exhibiting self-conceit, a view of themselves that says they are superior to others.<br> <br>But when we help kids respect themselves, we teach them to focus on others, and how others feel and what others need. This perspective, in turn, leads children to see everything through a window, seeing their own images reflected against the world beyond the glass, rather than in a mirror, and to grow up believing &#x201c;it&#x2019;s more about others and less about me.&#x201d;<br> <br>So what&#x2019;s the bottom-line difference between self-esteem and self-respect? Self-esteem is &#x201c;me centered,&#x201d; while self-respect is &#x201c;others centered.&#x201d;<br> <br>The quest for self-esteem has turned the world upside down. Shifting to the pursuit of self-respect will turn the world right-side up again. Why? Because kids with self-respect put others ahead of themselves. They feel an obligation to others and a responsibility to society. Bullies can&#x2019;t rock their foundation, because kids who have self-respect know who they are and what they stand for. They have a balanced view of the world. Their confidence is balanced with humility; they exhibit humble confidence.<br><br><br> <br>Self-respect is the fruit of discipline; the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.<br> <br>&#x2014;Abraham J. Heschel<br> <br><br><br>If you are parenting to build self-respect in your children, you&#x2019;ll focus on who your kids are becoming rather than on how much you give them. You&#x2019;ll teach them how to serve others rather than to expect to be served. You&#x2019;ll teach them to contribute to the world rather than to expect the world to give to them. You&#x2019;ll teach your kids to do their best, whether that means being number one or not, and to work toward goals so they can experience the satisfaction and confidence that a job well done brings.<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s sum up the different results of these two parenting goals:<br> <br>Self-Esteem<br> <br>Self-Respect<br> <br>Happiness (which is fleeting)<br> <br>Joy (which is lasting)<br> <br>Greed<br> <br>Gratitude<br> <br>Arrogance<br> <br>Obedience<br> <br>Insecurity<br> <br>Confidence<br> <br>Discontentment<br> <br>Contentment<br> <br>Futility<br> <br>Perseverance<br> <br>Self-centeredness<br> <br>Others-centeredness<br> <br>Ill-mannered<br> <br>Well-mannered<br> <br>The result of parenting to build self-esteem? Undisciplined, rude, greedy, disrespectful, and ill-mannered children. The result of parenting to develop self-respect? Disciplined, caring, productive, respectful, and well-mannered children.<br> <br>Unfortunately, because our society for the past four decades has emphasized self-esteem rather than self-respect in kids, we have far more disrespectful children than respectful children. Consequently, old-fashioned courtesies are considered unimportant, and we&#x2019;ve lost our moral foundation.<br> We Lost Our Manners and Therefore Lost Our Morals<p></p> <br>TODAY, IT&#x2019;S THE RARE CHILD who says:<br> <br>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes Sir&#x201d; and &#x201c;Yes Ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; (Yes, I&#x2019;m from the Deep South. Frankly, I wish the rest of the country would follow us on this one. There is no better vehicle for teaching young children respect than through the use of &#x201c;Sir&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;)<br> <br>&#x201c;May I get your chair?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the quest for self-esteem, such courtesies have become uncommon, at least among the members of the new royalty. Little kings and queens are not expected to humble themselves before others by extending common courtesies.<br> <br>Judith Martin, better known as the syndicated columnist &#x201c;Miss Manners,&#x201d; offers this insightful explanation of the critical importance of manners:<br> <br>The attitude that the wishes of others do not matter is exactly what manners are intended to counter. And no one has yet come up with a satisfactory substitute for family etiquette training in the earliest years of life to foster the development of the child in such principles of manners as consideration, cooperation, loyalty, respect.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As a result of the ever-wider abandonment of home etiquette training, schools have become increasingly stymied by problems they identify as lack of discipline and commitment to moral behavior.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A society can hope to function virtuously only when it also recognizes the legitimacy of manners.5<br> <br>Respect lies at the heart of manners and morals. A person&#x2019;s respect for authority, respect for others, and respect for self go a long way toward determining the moral decisions that person makes. Manners instilled in the early years become the foundation for moral behavior in the later years.<br><br><br> <br>Respect for ourselves guides our morals; respect for others guides our manners.<br> <br>&#x2014;Laurence Sterne<br> <br><br><br>Scripture affirms the relationship of morals and manners&#x2014;the content of the heart (morals) is the basis for outward behavior:<br> <br>The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.6<br> <br>Good people do good things because of the good in their hearts. Bad people do bad things because of the evil in their hearts. Your words show what is in your heart.7<br> <br>It&#x2019;s who you are, not what you say and do, that counts. Your true being brims over into true words and deeds.8<br> <br>In other words, the respectful child produces good deeds from a good heart, and a disrespectful child produces bad deeds from a corrupted heart. Whatever is in your child&#x2019;s heart determines what your child will say and do.<br> <br>If you want to raise respectful children in a disrespectful world, you must command their respect through a balance of love and discipline, especially in the...</p><h2>The Haunted Air</h2><p>Jack is back, for 2002. F. Paul Wilson's engaging, self-employed, off-the-books fixer, Repairman Jack, returns for another intense, action-packed adventure just a little over the border into the weird, in <i>The Haunted Air</i>. First introduced years ago in the bestseller <i>The Tomb</i>, Jack has been the hero of a series of exciting novels set in and around New York City including Legacies, Conspiracies, All the Rage, and Hosts. "Repairman Jack is a wonderful character, ultracompetent but still vulnerable. Wilson strolls into X-Files territory and makes it his own, keeping the action brisk and the level of suspense steadily rising," said the San Francisco Examiner &amp; Chronicle.<br><br>In Astoria, Queens, the lively ethnic neighborhood just across the river from Manhattan, a house is being haunted by the ghost of a nine-year-old girl in riding clothes. More than two decades before, she'd been abducted from stables in Brooklyn. Now it's up to Jack to uncover the truth of her story and liberate the pretty, blond spirit. Perhaps the answer is in the odd little store called the Shurio Coppe? Ah, but that would be telling.<br><br>Jack does things no human being should be able to do, but we watch, in horrified fascination, as the forces of evil seem about to triumph and fill the world with eternal darkness. And then-- but you must read the book.<br></p><p>F. Paul Wilson, a<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of horror, adventure, medical thrillers, science fiction, and virtually everything in between, is a practicing physician who resides in Wall, New Jersey.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The bride wore white.<br>Only she wasn't a bride and the dress--two sizes too small at least--had faded to beige.<br>"Can I ask again," Jack said, leaning toward Gia, "why our hostess is wearing her wedding dress?"<br>Gia, seated next to him on the tattered, thirdhand-store sofa, sipped from her plastic cup of white wine. "You may."<br>A casual little get-together, Gia had told him. Some of her artist friends were going to gather at a loft in a converted warehouse on the fringe of the old Brooklyn Army Terminal, throw a little party for one of their clan who'd started to make it big. Come on, she'd said. It'll be fun.<br>Jack wasn't in a fun mood. Hadn't been for some time now. But he'd agreed to go. For Gia.<br>Maybe twenty people wandering about the space while Pavement's last album pounded from a boom box, echoing off the high ceilings, huge windows, and stripped-to-the-brick walls. The occupants sported hair colors that spanned the visible spectrum, skin that was either pierced or tattooed or both, and clothes that redlined the garishometer.<br>And Halloween was better than two months away.<br>Jack took a pull from his bottle of beer. He'd brought his own, opting to forego his usual Rolling Rock long necks for a six-pack of Harp. Good thing, too. The bridal-bedecked hostess had stocked Bud Light. He'd never tasted watered-down cow pee, but he imagined it tasted better than Bud Light.<br>"All right. Why is our hostess wearing her wedding dress?"<br>"Gilda's never been married. She's an artist, Jack. She's making a statement."<br>"What statement? I mean, besides <i>Look at me</i>?"<br>"I'm sure she'd tell you that it's up to the individual to decide."<br>"Okay. I've decided she just wants attention."<br>"Is that so bad? Just because you're frightened to death of attention doesn't make it wrong for other people to court it."<br>"Not frightened to death of it," Jack grumbled, not wanting to concede the point.<br>A tall, slim woman passed by then, a dead-white streak running along the side of her frizzy black swept-back hair.<br>He cocked his head toward her. "I know her statement: her husband's a monster."<br>"Karyn's not married."<br>A guy with gelled neon yellow hair slid by, each eyebrow pierced by at least a dozen gold rings.<br>"Hi, Gia," he said with a wave and kept moving.<br>"Hi, Nick."<br>"Let me guess," Jack muttered. "As a child Nick was frightened by a curtain rod."<br>"My, aren't we the cranky one tonight," Gia said, giving him a look.<br>Cranky barely touched it. He'd been alternating between bouts of rage and the way-down dumps for a couple of months now. Ever since Kate's death. Couldn't seem to pull himself out. He'd been finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning, and once he was up, there didn't seem to be anything he wanted to do. So he'd drag himself to Abe's or Julio's or Gia's and pretend he was fine. Same old Jack, just not working on anything at the moment.<br>The angry voice mail messages from his father, ragging on him for not showing up at Kate's wake or funeral, hadn't helped. "<i>Don't tell me you had something more important to do. She was your</i> sister, <i>down it</i>!"<br>Jack knew that. After fifteen years of separation, Kate had come back into his life for one week during which he'd gotten to know her again, love her again, and now she was gone. Forever.<br>The facts said it wasn't Jack's fault, but the facts didn't keep Jack from blaming himself. And one other person...<br>He'd searched for the man he'd suspected of being in some way responsible, a man whose real name he didn't know but who'd called himself Sal Roma once, and maybe Ms. Aralo too. He'd put the word out but no one knew anything. Never heard of him. Jack wound up with a taste of his own medicine--Sal Roma didn't seem to exist.<br>Kate...she might still be alive if only he'd done things his way instead of listening to...<br>Stop. No point in traveling that well-worn trail again. He hadn't returned his father's calls. After a while they stopped.<br>He forced a smile for Gia. "Sorry. Pseudo-weirdos crank me off."<br>"Can't be much weirder than the people you spend most of your day with."<br>"Those are different. They're real. Their weirdness comes from inside. They wake up weird. They dress weird because they reach out a hand and whatever it touches first is what they wear that day. These people here spend hours in front of a mirror making themselves look weird. My weirdos have hair that spikes out in twenty directions because that's the way it was when they rolled out of bed this morning; these folks use herbal shampoo, half a gallon of gel, and a special comb to achieve their unwashed bed-head look. My weirdos don't belong; these people seem to want desperately to belong, but don't want anyone to know, so they try to outdo each other to look like outsiders."<br>Gia's lips twisted. "And the biggest outsider of them all is sitting right here in a short-sleeve plaid shirt, jeans, and work boots."<br>"And spending the evening watching pretensions collide with affectations. Present company excluded, of course."<br>One of the many things he loved about Gia was her lack of affectation. Her hair was blond by nature and short for convenience. Tonight she was wearing beige slacks and a sleeveless turquoise top that heightened the blue of her eyes. Her makeup consisted of a touch of lipstick. She didn't need anything more. She looked clean and healthy, a very untrendy look in this subculture.<br>But the subculture had percolated into the overculture, the fringe had become mainstreamed. Years ago construction workers threw bricks at longhairs and called them faggots, now the building trades were packed with ponytails and earrings.<br>"Maybe it's time I got myself adorned," Jack said.<br>Gia's eyebrows shot up. "You mean pierced? You?"<br>"Well, yeah. Sometimes I feel like I stand out because I'm not bejeweled and be-inked."<br>"Be-inked?"<br>"You know--tattooed."<br>Everyone seemed into it, and if he wanted to remain invisible, he'd have to follow the crowd.<br>"But nothing permanent," he added. Didn't want to lose his chameleon capabilities. "Maybe a clip-on earring and one or two of those temporary tattoos."<br>"Didn't you do something like that to your fingers once?"<br>"You remember those?" Phony prison tats. With indelible ink. A one-time thing for a hairy job that left a couple of toughs from a Brighton Beach gang blazing mad and combing the five boroughs for a guy with HELL BENT tats on his knuckles. He hadn't been able to wash those off soon enough. "No, I think I need something big and colorful."<br>"How about a heart encircled with rose vines and GIA in its center?"<br>"I was thinking more on the order of a green skull with orange flames roaring out of its eye sockets."<br>"Oh, how cool," Gia said, and sipped her wine.<br>"Yeah. Slap that on one deltoid, maybe get a bright red Hot Stuff devil for the other, put on a tank top, and I'll be set."<br>"Don't forget the earring."<br>"Right. One of those dangly ones, maybe with the Metallica logo."<br>"That's you, Jack. A speedmetal dude."<br>Jack sighed. "Adorned...accessorized...I was brought up thinking that real men didn't bother with fashion."<br>"So was I," Gia said. "But I have an excuse: I grew up in semi-rural Iowa. You...you're a northeasterner."<br>"True, but all the adult males I knew as a kid--my father and the men he knew--were plain dressers. Most had fought in Korea. They dressed up for things like weddings and funerals, but mostly they wore functional clothes. Nobody accessorized. You stayed in front of the mirror long enough to shave and comb the hair out of your eyes. Anything more and you were some sort of peacock."<br>"Welcome to twenty-first-century Peacockville," Gia said.<br>Nick drifted by again.<br>"What's Nick paint?" Jack asked.<br>"He doesn't paint. He's performance artist. His stage name is Harry Adamski."<br>"Swell." Jack hated performance art. "What's his performance?"<br>Gia bit her upper lip. "He calls it stool art. Let's just say it's a very personal form of sculpture and, um, let it go at that."<br>Jack stared at her. What was Gia--?<br>"Oh, jeez. Really...?"<br>She nodded.<br>"Christ," he said, letting loose, "is there anything out there that <i>can't</i> claim it's an art? There's the art of war, the art of the deal, the art of the shoe shine, the Artist Formerly Known As Prince--"<br>"I think he's back to calling himself Prince now."<br>"--the art of motorcycle maintenance. Smearing yourself with chocolate is art, hanging a toilet on a wall is art--"<br>"Come on, Jack. Lighten up. I was hoping a night out would lift your spirits. You've got to rejoin the living. Lately your life's consisted of eating, sleeping, and watching movies. You haven't worked out or taken a job or even returned calls. I'm sure Kate wouldn't want you to spend the rest of your life moping around."<br>Jack knew Gia was right and looked away. He saw a willowy blonde in her mid twenties swaying in their direction. She carried a martini glass filled with reddish fluid, probably a cosmo. The bottom of her short, zebra-striped blouse did not meet the top of her low riding, skintight leopard miniskirt; in the interval a large diamond stud gleamed from her navel.<br>"Maybe I should pierce my navel," Jack said.<br>"Fine, but don't show me until you've shaved your belly."<br>"How about a pierced tongue?"<br>Gia gave him a sidelong glance and a sultry smile. "Now <i>that</i> could be interesting." She looked up and saw the blonde. "Oh, here comes Junie Moon, the guest of honor."<br>"That her real name?"<br>"Not sure. But that's the one she's used since I've known her. She was struggling along just like the rest of us until Nathan Lane bought one of her abstracts last year and started talking her up. Now she's about as hot as you can get."<br>"What's a Junie Moon original go for?"<br>"Twenty and up."<br>Jack blinked. "Twenty thou? She's that good?"<br>"Big difference between hot and good, but I like Junie's work. She creates this unique mix of hot and cold. Sort of a cross between De Kooning and Mondrian, if you can imagine such a thing."<br>Jack couldn't, because he couldn't recall any works by either.<br>"You sound happy for her."<br>"I am. She's a good kid. I've got almost ten years on her and she sort of adopted me as a surrogate mother over the past few years. Phones me a couple of times a week to chat, asks advice."<br>"And no hard feelings that she hit it and you haven't?"<br>"Not a bit. I won't say I don't wish it were me instead, but if it had to happen to someone else, I'm glad it was Junie. She's ditzy but she's got talent, and I like her."<br>That was Gia. The nurturer without a jealous bone in her body. Another of the many reasons he loved her. But even if it didn't bother her, it rankled Jack to see the crap that hung in the galleries and exhibits she was always dragging him to, while her own canvases remained stacked in her studio.<br>"Bet her stuff's not half as good as yours."<br>"Mine are different."<br>Gia made her living in commercial art. She did a lot of advertising work, but over the years she'd developed a reputation among the art directors at the city's publishing houses as a talented and reliable artist. She'd walked Jack through a Barnes and Noble last week, pointing out her work on half a dozen hardcovers and trade paperbacks.<br>Nice stuff, but nothing like the paintings Gia did for herself. Jack loved those. He didn't know a lot about art, but he'd picked up a little following Gia around, and her urban roofscapes reminded him of Edward Hopper, one of the few artists he'd pay to see.<br>Junie dropped into the narrow space next to Gia on the couch, spilling a few drops of her drink. Her blue-shadowed lids drooped slightly. He wondered how many she'd had.<br>"Hey," she said, and kissed Gia on the cheek.<br>Gia introduced her to Jack and they shook hands across Gia. She looked about as down in the dumps as Jack felt.<br>Gia nudged her. "Why so glum? This party's for you."<br>"Yeah, I'd better enjoy it now." She took a gulp of her cosmopolitan. "My fifteen minutes are so over."<br>"What are you talking about?"<br>"My lucky bracelet. It's gone. It's the whole reason for my success."<br>"You think it was stolen?" Jack said, glancing at her bare wrists and then at the partygoers. No shortage of jealousy here, he'd bet. "When did you last see it?"<br>"Tuesday. I remember taking it off after finishing a painting. I took a shower, then went out shopping. Next morning I went to put it on before starting a new work, and it was gone."<br>"Anything else missing?" Jack said.<br>"Not a thing." She tossed back the rest of her drink. "And it's not valuable. It's an old piece of junk jewelry I picked up at a secondhand store. It looks homemade--I mean, it's set with a cat's eye marble, of all things--but I liked it. And as soon as I started wearing it, my paintings began to sell. The bracelet made it happen."<br>"Is that so?" Jack said. He felt Gia's hand grip the top of his thigh and begin to squeeze, trying to head off what she knew he was going to say, but he spoke anyway. "So it's got nothing to do with talent."<br>Junie shook her head and shrugged. "I never changed my style, but I started wearing the bracelet while I worked, and the first painting I finished with it was the one Nathan Lane bought. After that, everything started happening for me. It changed my luck. I've so got to find it."<br>"You've looked for it, I presume," Gia said.<br>"Turned my place upside down. But tomorrow I'm getting professional help."<br>"A bloodhound?" Jack offered, which earned him another squeeze.<br>"No. I've got an appointment with my psycho." She giggled. "I mean my psychic."<br>Gia's fingers became a vise, so Jack decided to heed her. "I'm sure he'll be a big help."<br>"Oh, I know he will! He's wonderful! I left my old seer for Ifasen a couple of months ago and am I ever glad. The man's absolutely incredible."<br>"Ifasen?" Jack knew most of the major players in the local psychic racket, if not personally, at least by rep, and the name Ifasen didn't ring a bell.<br>"He's new. Just moved into Astoria and--oh, my God! I just realized! That's just up the road from here! Maybe I can see him tonight!"<br>"It's pretty late, Junie. Will he--?"<br>"This is an emergency! He's got to see me!"<br>She pulled out her cell phone and speed-dialed a number, listened for a moment, then snapped it closed.<br>"Damn! His answering service! So what. I'm going up there anyway." She pushed herself up from the couch and staggered a step. "Gotta find a cab."<br>Gia glanced at Jack, concern in her eyes, then back to Junie. "You'll never get one around here."<br>She grinned and hiked her miniskirt from mid-thigh to her hip. "Sure I will. Just like what's-her-name in that movie."<br>"Claudette Colbert in <i>It Happened One Night</i>," Jack said automatically as he wondered when the last time was a cab had cruised the Brooklyn Army Terminal area at this hour. "And someone'll think you're looking for more than a ride if you do that. We'll call you a cab."<br>"They never come," she said, heading for the door.<br>Again that concerned look from Gia. "Jack, we can't let her go. She's in on condition--"<br>"She's a grown-up."<br>"Only nominally. Jack?"<br>She cocked her head and looked at him with big, Girl Scout cookie-selling eyes.

Proven�al cookbooks and guidebooks entice with provocatively fresh salads and azure skies, but is it really all C�tes-du-Rh�ne and fleur-de-lis? Author Peter Mayle answers that question with wit, warmth, and wicked candor in A Year in Provence, the chronicle of his own foray into Proven�al domesticity. Beginning, appropriately enough, on New Year&#39;s Day with a divine luncheon in a quaint restaurant, Mayle sets the scene and pits his British sensibilities against it. &#34;We had talked about it during the long gray winters and the damp green summers,&#34; he writes, &#34;looked with an addict&#39;s longing at photographs of village markets and vineyards, dreamed of being woken up by the sun slanting through the bedroom window.&#34; He describes in loving detail the charming, 200-year-old farmhouse at the base of the Lub�ron Mountains, its thick stone walls and well-tended vines, its wine cave and wells, its shade trees and swimming pool--its lack of central heating. Indeed, not 10 pages into the book, reality comes crashing into conflict with the idyll when the Mistral, that frigid wind that ravages the Rh�ne valley in winter, cracks the pipes, rips tiles from the roof, and tears a window from its hinges. And that&#39;s just January. In prose that skips along lightly, Mayle records the highlights of each month, from the aberration of snow in February and the algae-filled swimming pool of March through the tourist invasions and unpredictable renovations of the summer months to a quiet Christmas alone. Throughout the book, he paints colorful portraits of his neighbors, the Proven�aux grocers and butchers and farmers who amuse, confuse, and befuddle him at every turn. A Year in Provence is part memoir, part homeowner&#39;s manual, part travelogue, and all charming fun. --L.A. Smith</p><p>They had been there often as tourists. They had cherished the dream of someday living all year under the Provencal sun. And suddenly it happened. <br>Here is the month-by-month account of the charms and frustrations that Peter Mayle and his wife -- and their two large dogs -- experience their first year in the remote country of the Luberon restoring a two-centuries-old stone farmhouse that they bought on sight. From coping in January with the first mistral, which comes howling down from the Rhone Valley and wreaks havoc with the pipes, to dealing as the months go by with the disarming promises and procrastination of the local masons and plumbers, Peter Mayle delights us with his strategies for survival. He relishes the growing camaraderie with his country neighbors -- despite the rich, soupy, often impenetrable patois that threatens to separate them. He makes friends with boar hunters and truffle hunters, a man who eats foxes, and another who bites dentists; he discovers the secrets of handicapping racing goats and of disarming vipers. And he comes to dread the onslaught of tourists who disrupt his tranquillity. <br>In this often hilarious, seductive book Peter Mayle manages to transport us info all the earthy pleasures of Provencal life and lets us live vicariously in a tempo governed by seasons, not by days. George Lang, who was smitten, suggests: "Get a glass of marc, lean back in your most comfortable chair, and spend a delicious year in Provence."&#34;I really loved this book. Having spent several seasons in the backcountry of Provence myself, I found myself laughing in recognition of the Provencal explanation, for example, of an unusually cold winter: it was simply that the cold had all slipped down from Russia because the land had flattened between there and Provence. Then the raucous rebuilding of their house, and their plumbing, and the middle-aged plumber himself, who plays the clarinet at home, and will party of an evening, whirling his wife around the dance floor until six in the morning. The wonderful local meals Mayle describes, with pates and hams and mammoth stews, and olives, and sausages, and slabs of country bread to wipe up the sauce while cleaning the plates for the next course. It takes the friendly eye and ear of a sympathetic foreigner to penetrate and then bring alive the unique and endearing culture that is Provence. This book will give you many a chuckle when you know the country, and will certainly prepare you to enjoy it if you don&#39;t.&#34;</p><h2>He Did Deliver Me From Bondage (Revised Edition)</h2><p>Assists Latter-day Saints in understanding the principles of the gospel that harmonize so perfectly with the principles in each of the Twelve Steps of recovery.

Bekoff skillfully blends extraordinary stories of animal joy, empathy, grief, embarrassment, anger, and love with the latest scientific research confirming the existence of emotions that common sense and experience have long implied. Filled with Bekoff&#x2019;s light humor and touching stories, <i>The Emotional Lives of Animals</i> is a clarion call for reassessing both how we view animals and how we treat them.</p><p><p>If the onus on <i>Emotional Lives of Animals</i> author Marc Bekoff was simply to prove that nonhuman creatures exhibit Charles Darwin's six universal emotions (anger, happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, and surprise), then his book would be very brief. As anyone who has ever had a pet dog, cat, rabbit, or even bird can attest, animals not only possess such emotions but broadcast them clearly and often. Bekoff's goal, however, is much grander: To show that wild and domestic species have a kaleidoscopic range of feelings, from embarrassment to awe, and that we dismiss them not only at their peril but our own. And if an endorsement squib by PETA president Ingrid Newkirk and Foreword by renowned animal scientist Jane Goodall doesn't give it away, then readers quickly learn that Bekoff also has an agenda: showing that using animals for scientific experiments, amusement, food, and the like is reprehensible and unconscionable. </p> Not that <i>The Emotional Lives of Animals</i> is a polemic. By turns funny, anecdotal, and deeply researched, the book is all the more persuasive because it's so compelling. As Bekoff (professor emeritus of biology at the University of Colorado) points out, "It's bad biology to argue against the existence of animal emotions. Scientific research in evolutionary biology, cognitive ethology, and social neuroscience supports the view that numerous and diverse animals have rich and deep emotional lives. Emotions have evolved as adaptations in numerous species, and they serve as a social glue to bond animals with one another." And with us, as Bekoff argues in this absorbing and important book. -- <i>Kim Hughes</i>"As a boy studying Buddhism in Tibet, I was taught the importance of a caring attitude toward others. Such a practice of nonviolence applies to all sentient beings -- any living thing that has a mind. Where there is a mind, there are feelings such as pain, pleasure, and joy. No sentient beings want pain; instead all want happiness. Since we all share these feelings at some basic level, as rational human beings we have an obligation to contribute in whatever way we can to the happiness of other species and try our best to relieve their fears and sufferings. I firmly believe that the more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes, therefore I welcome Marc Bekoff's book The Emotional Lives of Animals." <br>-- His Holiness the Dalai Lama <p>"Move over Darwin. And prepare to be moved. In The Emotional Lives of Animals, world-class scientist Marc Bekoff argues forcefully that our emotions are the gifts of our animal ancestors. Bekoff's new book itself is a gift that invites us to explore and appreciate the passionate lives of animals. Weaving in the latest scientific data about empathic mice and elephants suffering from PTSD with wonderful stories about laughing dogs and pissy baboons, Bekoff's forward-looking book offers both an explanation and an ethical compass that opens the door for hope in the ways in which we interact with other animals." <br>-- Dr. Marty Becker, resident veterinarian on Good Morning America and author of The Healing Power of Pets </p><p>"Marc Bekoff is one of those rare scientists who can talk real sense about animals because he is aware of being an animal himself. Read this wonderful book." <br>-- Mary Midgley, author of Animals and Why They Matter and The Ethical Primate </p><p>"An extraordinary, intelligent, and valuable book about a subject one might be forgiven for thinking taboo since it is so absent from discussion: an exploration of the other animals' feelings, the emotional makeup we share with them yet often do not know exists, forget entirely, deliberately ignore or casually disregard. Here we see animals, whole and complete, thinking their not-so-private thoughts, grieving, loving, jumping for joy, and fleeing that which is painful or upsetting and it makes us think about who they are and what our impact is and can be on their lives. Marc Bekoff captures not only poignant incidents of the animals' emotions as evidenced by observations and pure commonsense, but brings to each discovery his own vital repertoire of human emotion and expression. A glorious, moving, important book to enjoy and share." <br>-- Ingrid Newkirk, cofounder and president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) </p><p>"A thought-provoking, compassionate, and scholarly work from one of the world's most eminent behavioral scientists." <br>-- Dr. Ian Dunbar, founder of The Association of Pet Dog Trainers and author of Before &amp; After Getting Your Puppy </p><p>"In clear and convincing language, Mark Bekoff provides rational defense for what many of us already sense -- that animals can feel sorrow, joy, anger, and pleasure much as we humans do. Bekoff proves that this idea is not only compatible with the fact of evolution, but it is required by it. Once it considers the argument of this finely argued book, science will never be the same." <br>-- Dr David Rothenberg, professor of philosophy, New Jersey Institute of Technology and author of Why Birds Sing and Sudden Music </p><p>"In The Emotional Lives of Animals, Marc Bekoff has pulled together the growing body of scientific evidence that supports the existence of a variety of emotions in other animals, richly illustrated by his own careful observations. He suggests that it is a waste of time even to ask if chimpanzees, elephants, dogs, and so on experience happiness, sadness, despair, and anger - that this is self-evident to anyone who has spent time or shared his or her life in a meaningful way with animals. Combining careful scientific methodology with intuition and common sense, this book will be a great tool for those who are struggling to improve the lives of animals in environments where, so often, there is an almost total lack of understanding. I only hope it will persuade many people to reconsider the way they treat animals in the future." <br>-- Jane Goodall</p></p><h2>The Darkest Road (Fionavar Tapestry)</h2><p>As the Unraveller&#39;s armies march to battle and a plague-filled rain devastates the planet, the warriors of Light call upon one of the most ancient powers of evil to aid them in their struggle.

Their ostensible purpose was to have the five participate in the festivities attendant on the celebration of the fiftieth year of the reign of Ailell, the High King. In fact, there were darker premonitions underlying the mage&#x2019;s actions.</p> <p>In Brennin, a brutal drought was afflicting the kingdom. Ailell&#x2019;s older son, Aileron, had already been exiled for cursing his father&#x2019;s refusal to allow him to sacrifice himself on the Summer Tree in an effort to end the drought.</p> <p>In Fionavar, the five strangers quickly found themselves drawn into the complex tapestry of events. Kim Ford was recognized by the aged Seer, Ysanne, as the successor she had prophetically dreamt. Kim was initiated into the knowledge of the Seers by the water spirit, Eilathen, and presented with the Baelrath, the &#x201c;Warstone&#x201d; that Ysanne had been guarding. Kim was also shown the Circlet of Lisen, a gem that shone with its own light. The beautiful Lisen, a power of Pendaran Wood, had been the magical source and the beloved companion of Amairgen Whitebranch, the first of the mages. She had killed herself, leaping into the sea from her Tower, upon learning that Amairgen had died. Ysanne told Kim the prophecy that accompanied the Circlet: &#x201c;Who shall wear this next, after Lisen, shall have the darkest road to walk of any child of earth or stars.&#x201d; Later, as a last gesture of ultimate sacrifice on the eve of war, Ysanne, knowing Kim would have need of the old Seer&#x2019;s power in the days to come, used L�kdal, the magic dagger of the Dwarves, to kill herself&#x2014;but not before tracing a symbol on the brow of the sleeping Kim, which action enabled her to make of her own soul a gift for Kimberly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Paul Schafer and Kevin Laine were initiated in quite a different way. Paul played&#x2014;and lost&#x2014;a night game of chess with the High King in the palace of Paras Derval, during which an unexpected bond of sympathy was forged between the two. The next morning he and Kevin joined the band of the reckless Prince Diarmuid, Ailell&#x2019;s younger son, in a raid across the River Saeren to Cathal, the Garden Country. There, Diarmuid achieved his intended seduction of Sharra, the Princess of Cathal. After the company&#x2019;s return to Brennin, they passed a wild night in the Black Boar tavern. Late at night a song Kevin sang reminded Paul too acutely of the death in a car accident of Rachel Kincaid, the woman he had loved. Paul, blaming himself for the accident, which had occurred moments after Rachel had announced she was going to wed someone else, took a drastic step: he approached the High King and received Ailell&#x2019;s sanction to sacrifice himself in the King&#x2019;s stead on the Summer Tree.</p> <p>The next night, the glade of the Summer Tree in the Godwood saw an epic battle. As Paul, bound on the Tree, watched helplessly, Galadan the Wolflord, who had come to claim Paul&#x2019;s life, was opposed and driven back by a mysterious grey dog. The following night&#x2014;Paul&#x2019;s third on the Tree&#x2014;a red full moon shone in the sky on a new moon night, as Dana, the Mother Goddess, granted Paul release from his guilt, by showing that he had not, in fact, subconsciously willed the accident that had killed Rachel. As Paul wept, rain finally fell over Brennin. Paul, though, did not die. He was taken down from the Tree alive by Jaelle, the High Priestess of Dana. Henceforth Paul would carry another name: Pwyll Twiceborn, Lord of the Summer Tree.</p> <p>By now it was clear that an epochal confrontation was at hand: Rakoth Maugrim, the Unraveller, defeated a thousand years before and bound under the great mountain, Rangat, had freed himself and had caused the mountain to explode with a hand of fire to proclaim that fact.</p> <p>His freedom was to have immediate consequences for Jennifer Lowell, the fourth of the strangers. In Paras Derval she had witnessed an unsettling incident during a children&#x2019;s counting game. A young girl, Leila, had &#x201c;called&#x201d; a boy named Finn to &#x201c;take the Longest Road&#x201d; for the third time that summer. No one, not even Jaelle, who had also been watching, knew exactly what that meant, though Jaelle was quick to enlist Leila as an acolyte in the Temple. The next day, riding outside the town walls, Jennifer met Brendel of the lios alfar&#x2014;the Children of Light&#x2014;and a party of his people. She spent the night in the woods with them, and in the darkness they were attacked. Concerned about the arrival of the five strangers, Rakoth Maugrim had Galadan and Metran&#x2014;the traitorous First Mage of Brennin&#x2014;abduct Jennifer. She was bound to the back of the black swan, Avaia, and borne north to Rakoth&#x2019;s fortress of Starkadh.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the terrifying explosion of the mountain had caused the death of the aged High King. This led to a tense confrontation between Diarmuid and his brother, Aileron&#x2014;who had been disguised as Ysanne&#x2019;s servant since his exile. The potentially violent situation was ended by Diarmuid&#x2019;s voluntarily relinquishing his claim to the throne, but not before he&#x2019;d received a knife in the shoulder, courtesy of Sharra of Cathal, who had come to Brennin to seek vengeance on him for the deception that had led to her seduction.</p> <p>In the meantime, Dave Martyniuk, the last of the five strangers, had been separated from the others in the crossing to Fionavar. He ended up far to the north among the Dalrei, the &#x201c;Riders,&#x201d; on the Plain, and found himself drawn into the life of the third tribe, led by Ivor, their Chieftain.</p> <p>Ivor&#x2019;s young son, Tabor, fasting in the forest for a vision of his totem animal, dreamt a seemingly impossible creature: a winged, chestnut unicorn. Three nights later, at the edge of the Great Wood, Pendaran, he met and flew upon this creature of his fast, Imraith-Nimphais&#x2014;a double-edged gift of the Goddess, born of the red full moon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dave was escorted toward Brennin by a party of Dalrei led by Ivor&#x2019;s older son, Levon. The company was ambushed by a great number of the evil svart alfar, and only Dave, Levon, and a third Dalrei, Torc, survived by riding into the darkness of Pendaran Wood. The trees and spirits of Pendaran, hating all men since the loss of the beautiful Lisen of the Wood a thousand years before, plotted the death of the three men, but they were saved by the intervention of Flidais, a diminutive forest power, who claimed, among other things, to know the answers to all the riddles in all the worlds, save one: the name by which the &#x201c;Warrior&#x201d; could be summoned. As it happened, the search for this name was one of the tasks Ysanne had left with Kimberly.</p> <p>Flidais sent word to Ceinwen, the capricious, green-clad goddess of the Hunt, who had taken a special liking to Dave. The goddess arranged for the three friends to awaken safely on the southern edge of the Great Wood in the morning.</p> <p>She did more. She also caused Dave to find a long-lost object of power: Owein&#x2019;s Horn. Levon, who had been taught by wise old Gereint, the blind shaman of his tribe, then found the Cave of the Sleepers nearby&#x2014;a cave wherein Owein and the kings of the Wild Hunt lay asleep.</p> <p>The three friends rode south with this knowledge to Paras Derval, in time to arrive for the first council of Aileron&#x2019;s reign. The council was interrupted twice. The first time, by the arrival of Brock, a Dwarf from Banir Tal who knelt before Matt S�ren&#x2014;once King of the Dwarves&#x2014;and proffered the terrible tidings that the Dwarves, under the leadership of two brothers, Kaen and Bl�d, had helped the Unraveller to free himself by treacherously breaking the wardstone of Eridu, thus preventing any warning of Rakoth&#x2019;s stirring under the mountain. They had also found and delivered to Rakoth the Cauldron of Khath Meigol, which had the power to raise the newly dead.</p> <p>In the midst of this terrifying recitation, Kimberly suddenly saw&#x2014;in a vision shaped by the Baelrath&#x2014;Jennifer being raped and tortured by Rakoth in his fortress of Starkadh. She gathered Dave, Paul, and Kevin around her, reached out for Jennifer with the wild power of her ring, and drew the five of them out of Fionavar back to their own world.</p> <p>And so ended <i>The Summer Tree.</i></p> <p><i>The Wandering Fire</i> picked up the story some six months later, in November and back in Toronto, with Kimberly waiting for the dream that would give her the Warrior&#x2019;s summoning name. Jennifer, badly scarred in her soul and carrying the child of Rakoth Maugrim&#x2014;having vowed to give birth to that child as her answer to the Dark&#x2014;was brought early to her time by a sudden crossing back to Fionavar. The crossing was achieved by Paul when the two of them were threatened by Galadan, who had crossed to their world in pursuit of Paul.</p> <p>In Fionavar, Jennifer&#x2019;s child, Darien, was left to be secretly fostered in the house of Vae and Shahar, the parents of Finn&#x2014;the boy called by the children&#x2019;s counting game to &#x201c;take the Longest Road.&#x201d; The only persons informed of the secret were the priestesses of Dana, because Paul and Jennifer needed Jaelle&#x2019;s magic to send them home.</p> <p>The following spring Kim finally had the dream for which she had been waiting. As a result, the five traveled to Stonehenge where Kim raised the spirit of Uther Pendragon by the power of the Baelrath and compelled him to name his son&#x2019;s resting place. Kim then went alone, by the magic she carried, to Glastonbury Tor and there&#x2014;having first sent the others ahead to Fionavar&#x2014;she drew the Warrior, Arthur, from his rest by the summoning name: Childslayer. The name was an echo of the sin Arthur had committed in his youth after discovering his inadvertent incest with his sister. Kim and the Warrior followed the others to Paras Derval.</p> <p>An icy winter gripped Fionavar, even as midsummer approached&#x2014;a winter so terrible that Fordaetha, the Ice Queen of R�k, was able to come as far south as Paras Derval. She almost killed Paul in the Black Boar tavern before he succeeded in driving her back north. It was decided in council that Jaelle and the mages and Kimberly would join with Gereint, the old shaman, in an attempt to magically probe the source of the killing winter&#x2014;a necessary prelude to trying to end it.</p> <p>In the meantime the dimensions of Arthur Pendragon&#x2019;s tragedy were beginning to take shape as it became clear (to Brendel of the lios alfar, first of everyone) who Jennifer Lowell really was: Guinevere, beloved of Arthur and of Lancelot. Marred by her suffering in Starkadh, Jennifer withdrew to the sanctuary of Dana with Jaelle. It was Jaelle who explained that Vae and Finn had taken Darien (who was growing with the unnatural rapidity of all the andain&#x2014;children of mortals and gods) to Ysanne&#x2019;s cottage by the lake. There, Darien, seeming now to be a child of five years old, was growing up in the loving care of his foster mother and brother, who were troubled by two things: a power which caused his blue eyes to flash red, and an awareness that the child was drawn by voices in the storms of winter.</p> <p>On the Plain the Dalrei were hard-pressed. The winter had rendered the graceful eltor&#x2014;the creatures the Dalrei hunted and depended upon&#x2014;awkward and ungainly in the snow, which made them easy prey for Galadan&#x2019;s wolves. Ivor&#x2014;now Aven, or &#x201c;Father&#x201d; of all the Dalrei&#x2014;had herded the eltor down to the southeastern corner of the vast Plain, and there the gathered tribes guarded them as best they could. Until one attack included great numbers of the hideous urgach mounted upon six-legged monsters called slaug. Only the intervention of Diarmuid of Brennin, with Dave and Kevin in his company, saved the Dalrei from the first wave of the mounted urgach. And only the appearance of Ivor&#x2019;s son Tabor, riding Imraith-Nimphais, his deadly, winged mount with the shining horn, saved them from the second, larger wave. Ivor was painfully aware of the effect such flight had on Tabor, drawing him ever farther from the world of men.</p> <p>Shortly after, back in Brennin, another new strand entered the Tapestry. At the urging of Levon, Ivor&#x2019;s older son&#x2014;and having the reluctant agreement of Loren&#x2014;Kim and Dave, the bearers of what Levon thought to be the elements of an ancient verse that spoke of the waking of the Wild Hunt, went with a number of companions to the place at the edge of Pendaran Wood where the Cave of the Sleepers lay. The Baelrath shattered the stone at the cave mouth and then Dave&#x2019;s horn summoned forth Owein and the seven kings of the Hunt. With the shadowy sky kings wailing &#x201c;Where is the child?&#x201d; a child did, indeed, step forth to become one of the Wild Hunt: it was Finn, and this was the Longest Road to which he had been called.</p> <p>Most of the company, including Shalhassan the Supreme Lord of Cathal, and Sharra, his daughter, who had arrived from the south with reinforcements, made their way the next morning to Gwen Ystrat, the province of the Goddess; partly to meet Gereint, the shaman, there, partly in response to a report from Audiart, Jaelle&#x2019;s second in command, that the province was being beset by wolves. The company was led by the grey dog that had saved Paul on the Summer Tree, and who turned out to be Cavall, Arthur&#x2019;s hunting dog. They passed into the province of the Mother amid ice and snow on the day before Maidaladan&#x2014;Midsummer&#x2019;s Eve&#x2014;with all the ancient, erotic, blood magic such a night implied. That evening, with the aid of the other magic wielders, Kim descended into the designs of Maugrim and found a clue that enabled Loren to deduce that the winter was being shaped by Metran, the treacherous mage, using the Cauldron of Khath Meigol, and basing himself on the unholy island of Cader Sedat.

It&#x2019;s been nearly two decades since Pullman wrote <em>The Amber Spyglass</em>, so it was both thrilling and terrifying (<em>please be amazing, please be amazing...</em>) when I first cracked open <em>The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage</em> and began to read. I need not have worried--<em>The Book of Dust</em> is Pullman at his best. Neither prequel nor sequel to <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy&#x2014;Pullman calls this an &#x201c;equel&#x201d; and <em>La Belle Sauvage</em> is the first volume of a companion trio that can stand on its own. There are some familiar faces&#x2014;most notably an infant Lyra Belacqua and her daemon Pantalaimon--and a particularly delightful new one: a boy named Malcolm whose kind heart, curious mind, and unerring sense of good, are the reason baby Lyra makes it to the safety of Jordan College. As in his earlier books, Pullman explores themes of religious and political freedom, the nature of good and evil, science and philosophy. <em>The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage</em> is a glorious adventure that delivers heart-in-your-throat moments and much to think about as we wait (not so patiently) to see what will happen next...<em>--Seira Wilson</em>PHILIP PULLMAN is one of the most acclaimed writers working today.

Genograms of famous families&#x2014;Sigmund Freud, Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, the Kennedys, Jane Fonda and Ted Turner, Bill Clinton, Princess Diana, the Roosevelts, and Thomas Jefferson, to name a few&#x2014;bring the text to life, and help to elucidate the principles of family systems theory and systemic interviewing, which form the basis of genogram work. Once these principles have been explained, the authors go on to present the important clinical applications of genograms in both family therapy and family medicine. These applications include the effective assessment of patients&#x2019; risk for emotional problems such as anxiety or depression; structural patterns among families such as divorce and remarriage; relationship patterns such as enmeshment, conflicts, and cut-offs; recent and chronic life stressors such as pregnancy, acute illness, poverty, and racism; and family life cycle transitions and developmental crises, among other uses. By providing a fascinating view into the richness of family dynamics, McGoldrick and her coauthors provide an invaluable guide to clinicians for accurately charting a family&#x2019;s structure, making it easier to scan for potential problems and take proactive steps to utilize resources when necessary.</p><p></p><h2>the origins of political order: from prehuman times to the french revolution. francis fukuyama</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p><b>Francis Fukuyama</b> is the Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at Stanford University&#x2019;s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

In 1973, only 45 of the world's 151 countries were counted as "free" by Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization that produces quantitative measures of civil and political rights for countries around the world.1 That year, Spain, Portugal, and Greece were dictatorships; the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites looked like strong and cohesive societies; China was caught up in Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution; Africa saw the consolidation of rule by a group of corrupt "presidents for life"; and most of Latin America had fallen under military dictatorship. The following generation saw momentous political change, with democracies and market-oriented economies spreading in virtually every part of the world except for the Arab Middle East. By the late 1990s, some 120 countries around the world--more than 60 percent of the world's independent states--had become electoral democracies.2 This transformation was Samuel Huntington's third wave of democratization; liberal democracy as the default form of government became part of the accepted political landscape at the beginning of the twenty-first century.3Underlying these changes in political systems was a massive social transformation as well. The shift to democracy was a result of millions of formerly passive individuals around the world organizing themselves and participating in the political life of their societies. This social mobilizationwas driven by a host of factors: greatly expanded access to education that made people more aware of themselves and the political world around them; information technology, which facilitated the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge; cheap travel and communications that allowed people to vote with their feet if they didn't like their government; and greater prosperity, which induced people to demand better protection of their rights.The third wave crested after the late 1990s, however, and a "democratic recession" emerged in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Approximately one in five countries that had been part of the third wave either reverted to authoritarianism or saw a significant erosion of democratic institutions.4 Freedom House noted that 2009 marked the fourth consecutive year in which freedom had declined around the world, the first time this had happened since it established its measures of freedom in 1973.5<b>POLITICAL ANXIETIES</b>At the beginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century, malaise in the democratic world took several distinct forms. The first was the outright reversal of democratic gains that had occurred in countries such as Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, where elected leaders were busy dismantling democratic institutions by manipulating elections, closing down or buying independent TV and newspaper outlets, and clamping down on opposition activities. Liberal democracy is more than majority voting in elections; it is a complex set of institutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of power through law and a system of checks and balances. In many countries, official acceptance of democratic legitimacy was accompanied by the systematic removal of checks on executive power and the erosion of the rule of law.In other cases, countries that seemed to be making a transition from authoritarian government got stuck in what the analyst Thomas Carothers has labeled a "gray zone," where they were neither fully authoritarian nor meaningfully democratic.6 Many successor states to the former Soviet Union, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, found themselves in this situation. There had been a broad assumption in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that virtually all countries were transitioning to democracy and that failures of democratic practice would be overcome with the simple passage of time. Carothers pointed out that this"transition paradigm" was an unwarranted assumption and that many authoritarian elites had no interest in implementing democratic institutions that would dilute their power.A third category of concern has to do not with the failure of political systems to become or remain democratic but rather their failure to deliver the basic services that people demand from their governments. The mere fact that a country has democratic institutions tells us very little about whether it is well or badly governed. This failure to deliver on the promise of democracy poses what is perhaps the greatest challenge to the legitimacy of such political systems.An example of this was Ukraine. Ukraine surprised the world in 2004 when tens of thousands of people turned up in Kiev's Maidan Square to protest manipulation of that country's presidential election. These protests, which came to be known as the Orange Revolution, triggered a new election and the rise of the reformer Viktor Yushchenko as president. Once in power, however, the Orange Coalition proved utterly feckless, and Yushchenko himself disappointed the hopes of those who supported him. The government quarreled internally, failed to deal with Ukraine's serious corruption problem, and presided over a meltdown of the economy during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The result was the election in early 2010 of Viktor Yanukovich, the very man accused of stealing the 2004 election that had triggered the Orange Revolution in the first place.Many other species of governance failure plague democratic countries. It is well understood that Latin America has the highest level of economic inequality of any region in the world, in which class hierarchies often correspond to racial and ethnic ones. The rise of populist leaders like Hugo Ch�vez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia is less a cause of instability than a symptom of that inequality and the feeling of social exclusion felt by many who are nominally citizens. Persistent poverty often breeds other kinds of social dysfunctions, like gangs, narcotrafficking, and a general feeling of insecurity on the part of ordinary people. In Colombia, Mexico, and El Salvador, organized criminality threatens the state itself and its basic institutions, and the failure to deal effectively with these problems has undermined the legitimacy of democracy.India, to take another example, has been a remarkably successful democracy since its independence in 1947--an achievement all the more remarkable given its poverty, ethnic and religious diversity, and enormous size. (Why a longer historical view of Indian political development shouldlessen our surprise is the subject of chapters 10-12.) Nonetheless, Indian democracy, like sausage making, looks less appealing the closer one gets to the process. Nearly one-third of Indian legislators, for example, are under some form of criminal indictment, some for serious crimes like murder and rape. Indian politicians often practice an overt form of patronage politics, in which votes are traded for political favors. The fractiousness of Indian democracy makes it very hard for the government to make major decisions on issues like investments in major infrastructure projects. And in many Indian cities, glittering high-tech centers of excellence exist next to African-style poverty.The apparent chaos and corruption of democratic politics in India has frequently been contrasted to the quick and efficient decision making of China. Chinese rulers are not constrained by either a rule of law or democratic accountability; if they want to build a huge dam, bulldoze neighborhoods to make way for highways or airports, or mount a rapid economic stimulus package, they can do so far more quickly than democratic India.A fourth broad source of political anxiety concerns the economy. Modern global capitalism has proved to be productive and wealth-creating beyond the dreams of anyone living before the year 1800. In the period following the oil crises of the 1970s, the size of the world economy almost quadrupled,7 and Asia, based on its openness to trade and investment, saw much of its population join the developed world. But global capitalism has not found a way to avoid high levels of volatility, particularly in the financial sector. Global economic growth has been plagued by periodic financial crises, striking Europe in the early 1990s, Asia in 1997-1998, Russia and Brazil in 1998-1999, and Argentina in 2001. This instability culminated, perhaps with poetic justice, in the great crisis that struck the United States, the home of global capitalism, in 2008-2009. Free markets are necessary to promote long-term growth, but they are not self-regulating, particularly when it comes to banks and other large financial institutions. The system's instability is a reflection of what is ultimately a political failure, that is, the failure to provide sufficient regulatory oversight both at a national and an international level.8The cumulative effect of these economic crises has not necessarily been to undermine confidence in market-based economics and globalization as engines of economic growth. China, India, Brazil, and any number of other so-called emerging market countries continue to perform well economically based on their participation in global capitalism. But it is clear that the<i>political</i> job of finding the right regulatory mechanisms to tame capitalism's volatility have not yet been found.<b>POLITICAL DECAY</b></p><h2>Inspirations from France &amp; Italy</h2><p>In this luxurious new book, best-selling author and acclaimed interior designer Betty Lou Phillips presents fresh and inspiring design ideas from France, Italy, England, Portugal, and beyond, bringing old-world artistry to uptown European glamour.

From calendars to democracy to the very languages we speak, Western civilization owes a debt to these classical societies. Yet the Greeks and Romans did not emerge fully formed; their culture grew from an active engagement with a deeper past, drawing on ancient myths and figures to shape vibrant civilizations. <br><br> In <i>The Birth of Classical Europe</i>, the latest entry in the Penguin History of Europe, historians Simon Price and Peter Thonemann present a fresh perspective on classical culture in a book full of revelations about civilizations we thought we knew. In this impeccably researched and immensely readable history we see the ancient world unfold before us, with its grand cast of characters stretching from the great Greeks of myth to the world-shaping Caesars. A landmark achievement, <i>The Birth of Classical Europe</i> provides insight into an epoch that is both incredibly foreign and surprisingly familiar.</p><p><b>Simon Price</b> is a former lecturer at the University of Oxford, where he taught Greek and Roman history. <br><b>Peter Thonemann</b> has taught Greek and Roman history at Wadham College, Oxford, since 2007.Price and Thonemann, both historians of ancient Greece and Rome (Price is currently at Oxford University, Thonemann taught there previously), have created a multidisciplinary study with emphasis on three themes: memory (including the ancient Greeks' and Romans' memory of their own past); communal identity as defined by the ancients; and changing definitions of what constitutes "Classical." The book is saved from excessive, and specialized, detail in its first half by the frequent use of well-placed vignettes that enliven the text with fascinating anecdotal background. Covering two millennia, the book begins with the myth of Europa, and the authors traverse the distance from the mysterious Minoans to the Greeks, with appropriate attention to Hellenism and on to the Romans of the early Latin kingdom, the republic, and the establishment of the empire. Maps, diagrams, building plans, and illustrations are used effectively, and the narrative becomes truly enjoyable in the book's second half, especially regarding the Roman settlement of Britain. A coda describing the later history of the Roman Empire wisely details the competition among religions and the extraordinary impact of militant belief on politics, culture, and civilization in the West.

Mission is linked inextricably to humanity's sinfulness and need for redemption, and to God's provision of salvation in the person and work of Jesus Christ. This "good news" of salvation must be made known! The saving mission of Jesus constitutes the foundation for Christian mission, and the Christian gospel is its message. According to Andreas K�stenberger and Peter O'Brien, this significant theme has rarely been given its due attention in biblical theology. Motivated by their passion to see God's mission carried out in today's world, they offer a comprehensive study of the theme of mission. In <em>Salvation to the Ends of the Earth</em> they explore the entire sweep of biblical history, including the Old Testament, the second-temple period, each New Testament Gospel, Paul and his writings, and the General Epistles and Revelation. Among other questions, K�stenberger and O'Brien examine whether or not Old Testament Israel was called to mission, whether second-temple Judaism should be characterized as a missionary religion, whether Jesus limited his earthly mission to Israel or also embarked on a Gentile mission, and whether or not there is continuity between the missions of Israel and the missions of Jesus and the early church. They write, "It is our sincere hope that our Christian mission, which is first of all God's, will be founded on a biblical theology that takes its cue from the scriptural revelation as a whole." To that end, they offer this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume as a service to the worldwide church. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead.</p><p>Andreas J. K�stenberger (Ph.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) is professor of New Testament at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in North Carolina. He is also coauthor of <em>Salvation to the Ends of the Earth</em> and author of the article "Mission" in IVP Academic's <em>New Dictionary of Theology.</em>&#34;Together [K�stenberger and O&#39;Brien] have written a biblical theology of mission that listens carefully to the biblical texts and follows the Bible&#39;s &#39;story-line&#39; without flattening the diverse emphases of the various biblical books. Here is scholarship that matters: careful and even-handed, yet of transforming significance for all Christians serious about the mission of the church of Jesus Christ.&#34; (D. A.

While Kesey's Merry Prankster's were off tripping the light fantastic, the Diggers were transforming the Haight from a seedy district of abandoned Victorian houses into an evanescent paradise on earth.<p>For anyone who thinks that those were days only of peace, love and flower power, Ringolevio will be a revelation, as it evokes the gritty urban sensibility that supplied the backbone to the community's free flights of fancy.</p><p>Vastly entertaining, Ringolevio is at once high adventure, political screed, social history. and hyperbolic memoir.

Called a &#x201c;Superman of the Underground&#x201d; by <i>The Times</i> (London), he was the founder of the Diggers, a legendary anarchistic group in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s that supplied free food, housing, and medical aid to runaways. On April 6, 1978, the thirty-five-year-old Grogan was found dead on a subway car in New York City, possibly of a drug overdose. Besides his autobiography, Grogan was the author of <i>Final Score</i>, a fictional crime novel.<br><br>Peter Coyote is an actor, activist, novelist, songwriter, and Emmy-winning voice-over artist. After a short apprenticeship at the San Francisco Actor&#x2019;s Workshop, he joined the San Francisco Mime Troupe, where he became a prominent member of the San Francisco counterculture community and a founding member of the Diggers.

The title was a New York street game &#39;of life and death.&#39; &#39;Grogan thought that anybody who ever played that game would learn their position in life, &#39; Hopper said. &#39;He was out of New York, studied film making with Antonioni.

As a youngster, certain collectors, including his kinsman, Eduard von der Heydt, introduced him to ethnographic art. After immigrating to the United States in 1947, with $100 and two African sculptures, one a Guru mask, Muensterberger continued to collect African art, practice psychoanalysis and taught ethnopsychiatry. Returning to the U.S. in 1985, from London where he had "retired" in 1974, Muensterberger reopened his private practice. Muensterberger has written books and articles on ethnographic art, including <i>Collecting: An Unruly Passion</i> (1994). This article contains photographs of certain African sculptures in Muensterberger's collection, most notably the Guru mask, and is followed by some Thoughts on Collecting, a dialogue between the article's author and Muensterberger.A blend of compelling anecdotes and dull psychoanalysis, as Muensterberger (an N.Y.C. psychoanalyst) examines the whys and hows of manic collecting. Collecting, Muensterberger establishes at the outset, can be an ``all-consuming passion''--whether the quarry be seashells, books, paintings, or women (he cites Don Juan as a prototypical collector). The act of accumulating repeated examples of a beloved collectible, he says, reduces ``the tension between id and ego'' and becomes ``an experiment in self-healing''-- invariably, of a childhood trauma or anxiety. A magical relationship develops between collector and object, most blatantly in aborigines who collect heads or in the faithful who gather saints' bones, but evident in all collecting. Upon this familiar premise (that collecting is a sign of insecurity), which sometimes leans towards reductionism (belief in the power of relics is ``an illusory attempt at self-preservation''), Muensterberger lays a banquet of fine stories. The centerpiece consists of three psychobiographies: of Thomas Phillips, a cruel and selfish man who longed to possess one copy of every book in the world; of the novelist Honor&#x201a; de Balzac, obsessed with bric- a-brac; and of ``Martin G.,'' an acquaintance of the author's who adored porcelain, bronzes, netsuke, and other objets d'art. Around these three men flutter a host of other collectors, from Petrarch (who had a passion for coins) to Mario Praz (who spent his honeymoon collecting Roman antiquities) and the 17th-century Dutch who spilled fortunes on tulips. Almost all are men; most are smart; many are aware of the extent of their mania; and the one certain rule that governs them all is that they reach no saturation point: Collecting is the addiction par excellence. Too ideological to entrance most readers--but students of psychology will want to add this to their collections. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this, the latest edition of &#34;Migraine,&#34; he returns to his first book and enriches it with additional case histories, new findings, and practical information on treatment.To define &#34;migraine, &#34; suggests Oliver Sacks, one must embrace the dizzying variety of experiences of its sufferers. For some, the affliction features of a headache of monumental proportions. For others, there is no pain at all. Some attacks are triggered by weather, some intense light. Still others consist of intense light -- hallucinatory displays of dazzling loops, stars, and geometrics. &#34;Migraine&#34; is Sacks&#39;s brilliant examination of a debilitating ailment and the profound implications of neurological illness. Synthesizing his patients&#39; case histories with 2,000 years of human research into the problem, he casts the migraine as exemplar of our psychological transparency, a complex biological response to external factors. Here is a classic meditation on the nature of health and malady, on the unity of mind and body. Here, too, is Sacks&#39;s discovery of how the migraine shows us, through hallucinatory displays, the elemental activity of the cerebral cortex -- and potentially, the self-organizing patterns of Nature itself. Enormously compelling, compassionate, and profound, Migraine offers comfort for sufferers -- and insight to all.</p><p>"Written by one of the great clinical writers of the twentieth century, Migraine...should be read as much for its brilliant insights into the nature of our mental functioning as for its discussion of the migraine".<p>-- The New York Times Book Review</p>The bestselling author of <i>Awakenings</i>, <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat</i> and <i>Musicophilia</i></p><h2>American Emperor: Aaron Burr&#39;s Challenge to Jefferson&#39;s America</h2><p><b>In this vivid and brilliant biography, David Stewart describes Aaron Burr, the third vice president, as a daring and perhaps deluded figure who shook the nation&#x2019;s foundations in its earliest, most vulnerable decades. </b><br><br>In 1805, the United States was not twenty years old, an unformed infant. The government consisted of a few hundred people. The immense frontier swallowed up a tiny army of 3,300 soldiers. Following the Louisiana Purchase, no one even knew where the nation&#x2019;s western border lay. Secessionist sentiment flared in New England and beyond the Appalachians. <br><br>Burr had challenged Jefferson, his own running mate, in the presidential election of 1800. Indicted for murder in the dueling death of Alexander Hamilton in 1804, he dreamt huge dreams. He imagined an insurrection in New Orleans, a private invasion of Spanish Mexico and Florida, and a great empire rising on the Gulf of Mexico, which would swell when America&#x2019;s western lands seceded from the Union. For two years, Burr pursued this audacious dream, enlisting support from the General-in-Chief of the Army, a paid agent of the Spanish king, and from other western leaders, including Andrew Jackson. When the army chief double-crossed Burr, Jefferson finally roused himself and ordered Burr prosecuted for treason. <br><br>The trial featured the nation&#x2019;s finest lawyers before the greatest judge in our history, Chief Justice John Marshall, Jefferson&#x2019;s distant cousin and determined adversary. It became a contest over the nation&#x2019;s identity: Should individual rights be sacrificed to punish a political apostate who challenged the nation&#x2019;s very existence? In a revealing reversal of political philosophies, Jefferson championed government power over individual rights, while Marshall shielded the nation&#x2019;s most notorious defendant. By concealing evidence, appealing to the rule of law, and exploiting the weaknesses of the government&#x2019;s case, Burr won his freedom. <br><br>Afterwards Burr left for Europe to pursue an equally outrageous scheme to liberate Spain&#x2019;s American colonies, but finding no European sponsor, he returned to America and lived to an unrepentant old age. <br><br>Stewart&#x2019;s vivid account of Burr&#x2019;s tumultuous life offers a rare and eye-opening description of the brand-new nation struggling to define itself.</p><p>David O.

Happy Birthday, Addy opens with the protagonist leading a more stable life with her father now delivering ice and searching for a carpenter's position and her mother taking in laundry. Although both parents are being paid as free citizens, the realities of prejudice are clearly evident as Addy laments, "all the colored people got a strange kind of freedom here...There are jobs we can't get and shops we can't eat at just because of the color of our skin." Despite this, she learns the value of optimism from wise, old, blind M'Dear. Addy Saves the Day includes the excitement of a church fair sponsored for postwar family assistance and Abby helping to catch the thief who steals the raised monies. Both books have a good balance of emotion, historical facts, and suspense to keep readers interested; they are attractively illustrated with colorful vignettes and full-page paintings.

When his eyes opened in the darkened room after a fifteen-minute afternoon nap, he didn&#x2019;t move for a couple of minutes, letting full consciousness creep up on him. The clock next to his bed read 4:30.<br> <br>Ricci was thirty-one years old and after eight years in the NYPD, a sergeant. He lived alone in the basement of a beautiful brownstone in Brooklyn. A couple of windows up front by the sidewalk let in a good amount of light and kept his spacious living room from feeling like a cellar. Ricci was proud of his place and kept it pin neat. Over the past three years, he had accumulated some very nice things: a Persian carpet in bright yellows and blues, and several strikingly colorful, contemporary paintings that were already worth more than he&#x2019;d paid for them. He&#x2019;d also bought a brown leather sofa, two low, modern armchairs, and an antique wood marble-topped coffee table. On the wall opposite the paintings, built-in bookshelves held his library, his CDs and collection of LPs, a turntable and a pair of out-of-date but excellent JBL speakers, and a large flat-screen TV. Not many of New York&#x2019;s Finest lived so comfortably at his age.<br> <br>In the back half of the apartment, he&#x2019;d recently redone the kitchen&#x2014;stainless steel stove and refrigerator and granite countertops. A high-tech wine cooler that held thirty-six bottles hummed quietly next to the sink. Abutting the kitchen was the bedroom, where he was just opening his eyes.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d needed the nap. The previous night he&#x2019;d been out with about twenty other cops, dinner at Mario&#x2019;s to celebrate the retirement of Captain Greg Sheppard, his boss in Vice for the last five years, and a well-liked figure in the department. They&#x2019;d closed the bar at 4 A.M., and then this morning Ricci had been up at dawn for his weekly seven-mile run, after which he&#x2019;d done his laundry, picked up his dry cleaning, done some grocery shopping, had lunch with his cousin Victor and Victor&#x2019;s wife, Bette. But he had big plans tonight as well&#x2014;some business and then dinner at home and perhaps bed for the first time with the lovely Andrea Bernardi, whom he&#x2019;d been seeing for a month; she was coming over at 8:00. The nap was a hedge against fatigue.<br> <br>He showered, shaved, weighed himself&#x2014;rock steady at 180. In ten minutes, he was dressed in Dockers, tennis shoes, a Knicks sweatshirt against the light September chill. He&#x2019;d also be grabbing his bulkier generic gray hoodie before he ventured out, and a knit cap to pull down over his hair, cover his ears, though not so much for the cold.<br> <br>Sitting on his bed, he turned his cell phone back on and on a whim decided to take a look at his photo stream. In a minute he&#x2019;d traveled back six months and was staring at a picture he&#x2019;d taken of Teri Wright, a fellow cop and former girlfriend.<br> <br>A twinge of regret seeped into his consciousness. What had he been thinking when he let her go? Andrea was a beauty, sure, with a fragile Anne Hathaway look about her. But all of his past girlfriends were beauties&#x2014;it was the Golden Age of the single straight man; the pickings were endless.<br> <br>Teri, even among the stiff competition, was still near the very top. Now he stared at her smiling face on the screen of his phone. Much more Scarlett Johansson than Anne Hathaway, with a sexual energy and vibe that was even more powerful because of her maturity. Andrea wasn&#x2019;t yet twenty-five, still with (he guessed) a lot to learn; Teri was thirty-two and, from his experience, had pretty much mastered it all. And there had been a sweetness to it, too, combined with an ability to laugh at herself. And to make him laugh, which was much more rare.<br> <br>Ricci was a serial monogamist; in general, he loved the chase and the first few weeks, sometimes even months, of sexual intimacy, but after a while the excitement and desire, even with a Teri Wright, always tended to pale. He told himself that that was just who he was. He usually didn&#x2019;t worry about it, although now flipping back through some more pictures of Teri&#x2014;that topless monokini shot when they&#x2019;d been on their weekend at Turks and Caicos&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Lord.<br> <br>He felt the beginnings of arousal.<br> <br>Maybe he should call Teri again. It hadn&#x2019;t been the easiest breakup&#x2014;lots of tears and anger, but there was no way she could deny the chemistry they&#x2019;d shared. What about their true love? The commitment they&#x2019;d talked about? That breakup day came back to him now; it had been pretty ugly.<br> <br>Nevertheless, he thought it was entirely possible he could get her back. He could just give it a little more time, let things play out with Andrea over a couple more months, then give Teri a call. She&#x2019;d no doubt be resistant at first, but he was confident he could wear her down. It was definitely an idea. Let time work its healing magic, then move in.<br> <br>Shaking himself from his reverie&#x2014;he had work to do, after all&#x2014;he got out of the photo stream, left the phone facedown on his bedside table, grabbed his hoodie, and headed out.<br> <br>RICCI KEPT A small storage locker about five blocks from his house. There were perhaps eighty units in a low-rise brick building at the back end of a public parking lot&#x2014;$8 ALL DAY!&#x2014;although on a Saturday evening at a little past 5:00, the lot held only three cars. With his key, he unlocked the left-hand side door and let himself into the building. Turning on the overhead lights, he walked about a third of the way down to his locker. As usual, there wasn&#x2019;t a soul in the place.<br> <br>After working the combinations both on his own Master Lock and a built-in dial on the locker itself, he had the door open. Inside, the contents of the four shelves were arranged as neatly as he kept things in his home. The top shelf held a shoebox full of hundred-dollar bills&#x2014;$33,700 worth. He kept the exact updated count of deposits and withdrawals on a lined sheet of paper taped to the inside of the door. On the next shelf, he kept stored several boxes of ammunition and one of surgical latex gloves. The bottom two shelves held the guns&#x2014;some registered (not to him, of course) and some not, of several different calibers and makes&#x2014;that he&#x2019;d picked up in the course of his work over the years. Seven, all told.<br> <br>Moving quickly, he pulled out his new favorite, a Ruger LCR revolver&#x2014;five .357 Mag rounds and a barrel under two inches for easy concealment. Flipping open the cylinder, he slid the bullets home, snapped everything back into place. Five rounds were plenty. Hell, one was plenty for his needs, but he generally took two shots for certainty. If he needed more than five, he&#x2019;d probably wind up dead.<br> <br>Putting the gun in his hoodie&#x2019;s front pouch, he grabbed a couple of latex gloves, checked the shoebox for luck, just to see that the pile of bills looked all right. Checking both ways one more time, seeing no one, he closed the locker, twisted the first dial, and hooked in his own Master Lock.<br> <br>JAMES DI MARCO didn&#x2019;t want to let the summer get away without one last barbecue. Now here it was, the last weekend in September, and the forecast next week was rain, possibly sleet, the temp going down to the thirties. So yesterday he&#x2019;d bought four fat rib eyes and started them marinating soon after he&#x2019;d woken up this morning. They were going to be outstanding.<br> <br>The Weber was perfuming the entire Coney Island neighborhood with the smell of cooking meat, while James and Carla and the Jensens from down the street sat out in the backyard with their second pitcher of margaritas. Everyone was in slacks and sweaters, but nobody was cold. The sun wouldn&#x2019;t be setting for at least another half hour, and they had positioned themselves to enjoy its last rays.<br> <br>At forty-five, improbable as it was, James felt that his life had turned around at last. He didn&#x2019;t kid himself that this was through his own efforts, although he had learned how to play the game better, learned how to take advantage of opportunities he routinely couldn&#x2019;t identify when he&#x2019;d been younger. He wasn&#x2019;t part of Mr. Tedeschi&#x2019;s inner circle, of course, and not being related by blood, probably never could be. But he&#x2019;d worked his way up as Mr. Tedeschi had transitioned out of the stolen goods and drug business to an emphasis on the flesh trade, from driver and deliveryman to manager of an entire block of apartments, a euphemism for massage parlors, in Queens.<br> <br>And this was where James had begun to realize the bonus that Mr. Tedeschi had made available to him. It was simplicity itself, and though he knew that technically it was skimming, certainly as sins went it was more or less venial: reporting just a little less than he actually collected from the girls, he&#x2019;d been doing it so long and so successfully now that he&#x2019;d come to believe that Mr. Tedeschi actually, albeit tacitly, condoned it. This was how his lieutenants augmented their earnings, improved their lifestyles, and he didn&#x2019;t begrudge them for it. Over the years, the additional income had allowed James to keep Carla happy with a yearly cruise, some nice jewelry, and, perhaps most of all, this second house a few blocks from the beach.<br> <br>Out in the backyard, he heard the front doorbell ring. Tipping up the last sip of his margarita, he stood up from his chair, put his glass on the patio table, and asked, &#x201c;Anybody want anything while I&#x2019;m up?&#x201d;<br> <br>From the hallway, he could make out the outline of the caller through the glass of the front door. The sun was low and glaringly bright behind the man&#x2019;s figure, but as he got closer, James saw that it was a friendly-looking, young white guy. Opening the door and squinting in the sunlight, James said, &#x201c;Help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I sure hope so,&#x201d; the young man said, flashing a winning smile. &#x201c;Sorry to bother you, but I&#x2019;m looking for James Di Marco.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You found him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still smiling, he said, &#x201c;Mr. Tedeschi says to tell you, &#x2018;Thou Shalt Not Steal.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> <br>In an instant, Joe&#x2019;s face started to go dark with fear, and also with understanding.<br> <br>Ricci didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Oh, one last thing,&#x201d; he said, pulling the Ruger out and up. In one smooth motion, he stuck it under James Di Marco&#x2019;s chin and pulled the trigger twice.<br> <br>FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER, the gun locked away in his storage unit, the surgical gloves and the spent cartridges thrown into a trash container in the subway station on the way back, Ricci went down the four steps leading to his apartment, took out his key, inserted it into the lock, and started to push open the door.<br> <br>The minute he turned the knob, a pair of strong hands took hold of him from behind and pushed him forward into the door, which slammed open in front of him, and then he was thrown down onto the floor, his face into the Persian rug, three men holding him down. When he stopped struggling after only a few seconds&#x2014;resistance was obviously useless&#x2014;a calm and measured voice said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s four of us here and we&#x2019;re all armed and very dangerous, Tony. You are, by the way, under all kinds of arrest. But we&#x2019;re really here to talk to you, which would be easier and so much more pleasant if you were sitting up. You think you want to do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci raised his head and saw a man sitting at his kitchen table with an open bottle of wine and a couple of glasses in front of him, one of them half-filled. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll sit up. Let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No funny stuff.&#x201d; The man reached under his jacket and showed a gun. &#x201c;No kidding.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; The man nodded to his comrades, and the pressure behind him went away. &#x201c;One of you get the door, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci slowly got to his feet. He looked around, and sure enough, there were three other guys, all about his size, complete professionals. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; he asked the man at the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a seat,&#x201d; the guy said, indicating the other kitchen chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who the fuck are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man broke a tight smile. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, the introductions.&#x201d; He dug into his pocket and pulled out a wallet, which he opened to reveal a badge. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a little posse of federal marshals, Tony. My name is Frank Ladoux, and I predict that you and I are going to be good friends for a long time. Please, have a seat. Can I pour you a little wine? You&#x2019;re going to want, maybe need, something to drink pretty soon, I expect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ladoux tsked. &#x201c;Tony, please. A little respect.&#x201d; He leaned forward, picked up the wine bottle, and filled the bottom of Ricci&#x2019;s glass. &#x201c;Come on, take a sip. It&#x2019;s your bottle after all. It&#x2019;ll make you feel better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci picked up the glass and drank. &#x201c;Okay, now what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re going to tell us how much you know about Martin Tedeschi.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci hesitated, scanned the kitchen, came back to Ladoux. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a wine collector and business guy out in the Hamptons. He throws a lot of parties.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Parties where you&#x2019;ve provided security.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci nodded. &#x201c;Sometimes. So what? Half the force moonlights.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they do, but they don&#x2019;t usually become pals with their hosts, do they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not pals with Tedeschi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. If that&#x2019;s what this is about, you got the wrong guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ladoux shook his head. &#x201c;You disappoint me, Tony. You&#x2019;re a cop. You know what it&#x2019;s like to make an arrest. You don&#x2019;t do it without preparation and evidence up the ass. Isn&#x2019;t that right? So here we are, a team of four&#x2014;and believe me, the team is much bigger than that&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re acting like you think we don&#x2019;t have everything we need and then some. Of course we do. You&#x2019;re done, dude. You have only two ways to go: one, you roll over on Mr. Tedeschi or, two, starting tonight you go to jail for the rest of your natural life, which won&#x2019;t be too long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ladoux poured himself a glass of wine, took a sip, and put the glass down. &#x201c;Listen, you are the break we&#x2019;ve been looking for for at least two years. We know you&#x2019;re majorly connected to Tedeschi. We&#x2019;ve got pictures, we&#x2019;ve got tapes, videos, you name it. We know you&#x2019;ve been working for him for five years and know everybody who&#x2019;s anybody in his organization. We&#x2019;re going to want you to testify against these people so we can put them away where they belong.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci barked a laugh. &#x201c;And, even assuming that what you think you know is true, I&#x2019;m going to do this why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because otherwise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought I&#x2019;d made this clear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. otherwise, you&#x2019;re in prison forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, Ladoux shook his head, smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be honest with you, Tony. We don&#x2019;t know for sure yet how many people you&#x2019;ve hit, although the deposit list on the door of your locker ought to give us some leads on timing.&#x201d; Ladoux nodded. &#x201c;The locker? Oh, yeah, we know about that. In fact, we got its contents in evidence right now, collected by my colleagues right after you left, oh, about twenty minutes ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stalling for time, Ricci picked up his glass and drank up its contents.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here. Let&#x2019;s pour you some more of that. I&#x2019;ve got your attention now, don&#x2019;t I? We were talking about the number of people you&#x2019;ve hit, and the good news for us is we don&#x2019;t need a lot of bodies. We just need one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying you&#x2019;ve got proof I&#x2019;ve killed people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly, Tony, I&#x2019;d have to call it an embarrassment of riches.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I have a locker?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more what&#x2019;s in the locker, but that&#x2019;s a start. Seven guns that&#x2019;ll match ballistics with who knows how many dead people. Thirty grand plus in cash. Ammo.&#x201d; Ladoux held up his hand. &#x201c;Now, I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. That it&#x2019;s all circumstantial. There&#x2019;s probably no record you even rent that locker. Except we&#x2019;ve been filming it round the clock for the past four months, and it&#x2019;s pretty ...</p><h2>Posters of the WPA</h2><p>Briefly describes the history of the WPA Federal Art Project, explains the silk skreen process, and shows a variety of FPA posters promoting health, travel, the theater, and the war effort</p><p>Graphic artists of the Works Progress Administration produced thousands of bold, brightly colored, astutely modern posters.

Focusing on six of these ruthless men Hoffman reveals how a few players managed to take over Russia's cash-strapped economy and then divvy it up in loans-for-shares deals. <br><br> Before perestroika, these men were normal Soviet citizens, stuck in a dead-end system, claustrophobic apartments, and long bread lines. But as Communism loosened, they found gaps in the economy and reaped huge fortunes by getting their hands on fast money. They were entrepreneurs. As the government weakened and their businesses flourished, they grew greedier. Now the stakes were higher. The state was auctioning off its own assets to the highest bidder. The tycoons go on wild borrowing sprees, taking billions of dollars from gullible western lenders. Meanwhile, Russia is building up a debt bomb. When the ruble finally collapses and Russia defaults, the tycoons try to save themselves by hiding their assets and running for cover. They turn against each other as each one faces a stark choice--annihilate or be annihilated. <br><br> The story of the old Russia was spies, dissidents, and missiles. This is the new Russia, where civil society and the rule of law have little or no meaning.</p><p><b>David Hoffman</b> joined the <i>Washington Post</i> in 1982, and covered the Reagan and Bush presidencies as a White House correspondent.

Joseph Jaworski shows how a real leader can set the stage on which &#34;&#34;predictable miracles&#34;&#34; take place within an organization.</p><p>Synchronicity is an inspirational guide to developing the most essential leadership capacity for our time: how we can collectively shape our future. Through the telling of his life story, Jaworski posits that a real leader sets the stage on which &#34;&#34;predictable miracles&#34;&#34;, seemingly synchronistic in nature, can - and do - occur. He shows that this capacity has more to do with our being - our total orientation of character and consciousness - than with what we do. Leadership, he explains, is about creating - day by day - a domain in which human beings continually deepen their understanding of reality and are able to participate in shaping the future. He describes three basic shifts of mind required if we are to create and discover an unfolding future - shifts in how we see the world, how we understand relationships, and how we make commitments - and offers a new definition of leadership that applies to all types of leaders.Joseph Jaworski is a founder and the chairman of both Generon International and the Global Leadership Initiative and is the founder of the American Leadership Forum. In the early 1990s, he led the Shell International scenario team in London. He is a coauthor of Presence.</p><h2>No Plot?

Most people do not see themselves as biased towards people of different races or different genders. And yet in virtually every area of modern life disparities remain. Even in corporate America, which has for the most part embraced the idea of diversity as a mainstream idea, patterns of disparity remain rampant. Why?<br><br>Breakthroughs in the cognitive and neurosciences give some idea why our results seem inconsistent with our intentions. Bias is natural to the human mind, a survival mechanism that is fundamental to our identity. And overwhelmingly it is unconscious. <br><br>Incorporating anecdotes from today&#x2019;s headlines alongside case studies from over 30 years as a nationally prominent diversity consultant, Ross help readers understand how unconscious bias impacts our day-to-day lives and particularly our daily work lives. And, he answers the question: &#x201c;Is there anything we can do about it?&#x201d; by providing examples of behaviors that the reader can engage in to disengage the impact of their own biases. With an added appendix that includes lessons for handling conflict and bias in the workplace, this book offers an invaluable resource for a broad audience, from individuals seeking to understand and confront their own biases to human resource professionals and business leaders determined to create more bias-conscious organizations in the belief that productivity, personal happiness, and social growth are possible if we first understand the widespread and powerful nature of the biases we don&#x2019;t realize we have.<br></p><p>Howard J. Ross is founder and chief learning officer of Cook Ross Inc., a diversity consulting company. He is one of the nation's leading diversity consultants and a nationally recognized expert on diversity, leadership, and organizational change.<br>Founder of a diversity consulting company, Ross examines how to identify and overcome unconscious biases in everyday life. He takes up much more than discrimination based on race, gender, national origin, and other protected categories. The author delves into perceptions of Democrats and Republicans toward presidential candidates, patient income with respect to health care, shapes of objects relative to the shapes of objects around them, the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin criminal case, and homosexuality. Ross lists a wide variety of biases&#x2014;such as the tendency to anchor on one trait to make decisions and the inclination to make conclusions about a person based on first impressions&#x2014;and draws on numerous research studies to support his conclusions. He also points to ways to overcome both personal and organizational bias. The former includes accepting uncertainty in life, exploring awkwardness and uncomfortable feelings, and getting feedback from others; the latter, finding patterns of privilege or exclusion of employees, brainstorming, listening to dissenting opinions, and analyzing the quality of information obtained. . . .Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through faculty; professionals; general readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>The author explores the many biases that we each carry within us. Most people do not see themselves as biased towards people of different races or different genders. And yet, in virtually every area of modern life, disparities remain. Breakthroughs in the cognitive and neurosciences give some idea why our results seem inconsistent with our intentions. Bias is natural to the human mind, a survival mechanism that is fundamental to our identity. And, overwhelmingly, it is unconscious. Incorporating anecdotes from today&#x2019;s headlines alongside case studies from over 30 years as a nationally prominent diversity consultant, Ross helps readers understand how unconscious bias impacts our day-to-day lives and particularly our daily work lives. He also provides examples of behaviors that the reader can engage in to disengage the impact of their own biases.

Everyday Bias is an important guide to seeing oneself the way others might. (Ken Burns, filmmaker)<br><br>Howard Ross has done it again! Another gem that promises and delivers validated and practical methods for understanding our own biases. Everyday Bias explores those areas of bias that we all have and how it has meaningful, often negative impact for businesses, schools and society in general. For the casual interested reader or the chief diversity officer of an organization this book stands out as an invaluable guide to recognizing one&#x2019;s own biases and how to effectively interrupt our usual patterns of thinking and behavior. Moreover, it offers fresh thinking through vivid examples of promising practices to disrupt unconscious bias by organizations and corporations. Howard is the unique writer that can blend evidence based data, rigorous analytical research and invaluable personal knowledge to ensure every reader finds a new and important insight. (Marc A. Nivet, Chief Diversity Officer, Association of American Medical Colleges, Inc.)<br><br>The real genius of Everyday Bias is that it allows all of us to better understand bias without the guilt that often prevents us from addressing it. . . .

Written by a consummate professional in diversity and inclusion consultancy, this book reinforces my belief that we human beings have the capacity to discover a new and effective way to acknowledge our differences and to move toward a day when our differences do not make any more difference.

Leaders of all types will benefit from these questions, methods and techniques to foster engaged, innovative and powerfully productive teams. (Tony Byers, PhD, Corporate Chief Diversity Officer)<br><br>If you are human, you are biased. From this fundamental truth diversity expert Howard Ross explores the unconscious biases we each carry within us, working to inform every decision we make on a daily basis. Far from simply being malicious prejudgments of others and situations, these biases define what kind of decision makers we become, in the workplace, in the classroom, at the ballot box, and in our relationships with others. Incorporating anecdotes from today&#x2019;s headlines alongside case studies from over 30 years as a diversity consultant, Ross shows us how deeply rooted and relevant the discussions surrounding unconscious bias remains today.</p><h2>Whole Heart, Whole Horse: Building Trust Between Horse and Rider</h2><p>Many horse trainers, even those who espouse the so-called natural horsemanship approach, take the position that horses who fail to obey a human's request are doing so as much out of perversity as ignorance. That's not Mark Rashid's view. In his words, "If we understand that horses can't separate the way they feel from the way they act, then we can start to see that unwanted behavior isn't bad behavior at all. More times than not, it's just the horse expressing the way he feels at that particular moment in time. . . .How we perceive that information dictates how we respond to it."<br> <br> <em>Whole Heart, Whole Horse</em> focuses on this idea, covering such subjects as gathering information from the horse, turning rider/trainer mistakes into positive experiences, developing realistic boundaries between you and your horse, understanding how and why horses release energy from real or perceived traumas, and reaching a comfortable balance point between horse and rider. Rashid analyzes developing softness, consistency, dependability, trust, and peace of mind in both horses and humans, as well as how to become a leader whom your horse will willingly want to follow and work with. <br> <br> Full of examples that extend beyond the training pen, <em>Whole Heart, Whole Horse</em> offers good sense and information that will make you a more astute, capable, and sensitive horseman and person.</p><p><strong>Mark Rashid</strong> is an internationally-acclaimed horse trainer known for his ability to assess situations from a horse&#x2019;s point of view. He has committed himself to finding quiet but effective ways to resolve even the most difficult problems with horses and gives dozens of clinics each year, as well as private lessons. His clinic format of one-on-one work with horse and rider is immensely popular and has gained him legions of fans around the world. Rashid is the author of <i>Considering the Horse; Whole Heart, Whole Horse; Horses Never Lie</i>; and <i>Life Lessons from a Ranch Horse</i>. His books have been translated into several languages.&#x201c;Learning how to communicate with one's horse will make any owner a better and more sensitive horseman, and this book provides an excellent start.

From the "Seven Dirty Words" to "A Place for My Stuff," to "Religion is Bullshit," he perfected the art of making audiences double over with laughter while simultaneously making people wake up to the realities (and insanities) of life in the twentieth century. </p><p>Few people glimpsed the inner life of this beloved comedian, but his only child, Kelly, was there to see it all. Born at the very beginning of his decades-long career in comedy, she slid around the "old Dodge Dart," as he and wife Brenda drove around the country to "hell gigs." She witnessed his transformation in the '70s, as he fought back against---and talked back to---the establishment; she even talked him down from a really bad acid trip a time or two ("Kelly, the sun has exploded and we have eight, no-seven and a half minutes to live!"). </p><p>Kelly not only watched her father constantly reinvent himself and his comedy, but also had a front row seat to the roller coaster turmoil of her family's inner life---alcoholism, cocaine addiction, life-threatening health scares, and a crushing debt to the IRS. But having been the only "adult" in her family prepared her little for the task of her own adulthood. All the while, Kelly sought to define her own voice as she separated from the shadow of her father's genius. </p><p>With rich humor and deep insight, Kelly Carlin pulls back the curtain on what it was like to grow up as the daughter of one of the most recognizable comedians of our time, and become a woman in her own right. This vivid, hilarious, heartbreaking story is at once singular and universal-it is a contemplation of what it takes to move beyond the legacy of childhood, and forge a life of your own.</p></p><p>KELLY CARLIN was born in Ohio in 1963. She received her Master's Degree from Pacifica Graduate Institute. She presently tours her critically acclaimed solo show, "A Carlin Home Companion," hosts two radio shows&#x2015;<i>The Kelly Carlin Show</i> on SiriusXM and <i>Waking from the American Dream</i> on SModcast Network, and blogs for the Huffington Post.

Originally designed for architects and engineers, the technical pen moves smoothly and easily over the paper's surface and offers a precise and predictable line quality that can't be matched by any other type of pen, permitting both loose, gestural sketching and tighter, more deliberate renderings that make it an ideal tool for fine artists, illustrators, and graphic artists alike.<br>Simmons then shows how to put the pen strokes to work through step-by-step demonstrations that illustrate the ins and outs of good, solid image construction, from initial pencil sketch through final inking. He explains how to build form, tone, texture, and "color" in drawings, and how to make sure that the pen strokes do what you really want them to do&#x2014;a major concern in pen-and-ink rendering. For instance, perhaps you've added a layer of hatched lines over a bird's feathers to create a shadow effect, only to discover that you've suddenly obscured their texture, or maybe one area of your drawing has become too dark. Gary Simmons addresses these and other common problems of mastering the medium and tells how to avoid or solve them.<br>A special, ground-breaking section explores working with the new acrylic-based color inks, including advice on basic color theory, ink selection, color mixing and layering, and how to build an image in color step by step.<br>Gary Simmons, who has been teaching pen-and-ink techniques for some thirty years, covers every aspect of working with the technical pen, beginning with a thorough explanation of its anatomy, operation, and care and including troubleshooting tips as well as advice on choosing appropriate nib widths, inks, and drawing surfaces. He shows in detail how to achieve the wide variety of strokes and stroke patterns the technical pen makes possible&#x2014;continuous parallel line, crosshatching, stippling, and more&#x2014;and explores, with copious illustration, the different effects each of these can create alone and in combination.</p><p><b>Gary Simmons</b> has been working with pen and ink and the technical pen for nearly thirty years. Simmons has conducted pen-and-ink drawing workshops nationally for Koh-I-Noor, and he teaches fine arts at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.Simmons has written what could be termed the bible of technical pen artistry. The technical pen is widely used in drafting and in architectural renderings to make a narrow, consistent line but is often neglected by artists who rely on the quill (flexible nib) pen because of its ability to make lines of various thickness. Through numerous examples, the author demonstrates how to compensate for the lack of a flexible nib by using cross-hatching and line placement to create the desired effects.

Visit her on the web at www.cindachima.com.Grade 6 Up&#x2014;In this final installment in the trilogy, Chima spins a finely structured tale that roars to a satisfying conclusion. For readers new to the series, there is considerable work to be done sorting out the plot and the relationships among the various characters, but after a while the power of the story takes over. The wizarding world is fractured and at war with itself. The only hope for peace lies in those few unaffiliated gifted ones (wizards, warriors, enchanters) in the sanctuary of the town of Trinity. As the novel opens, one of these characters, Jason, steals into the hold of another faction and walks out with a mysterious magical object that appears to be extremely powerful: the Dragonheart. When he brings it back to Trinity, the town and its treasure become the focus of the other factions. The action is largely propelled by the emotional needs and weaknesses of the characters, and not simply by their magical abilities. Madison Moss, whose ability to absorb magic enabled her to save her wizard boyfriend, is now a danger to Seph because she keeps leaking the toxic magic that she absorbed. Her fear that this will be discovered, along with her family problems, leads to her making decisions that put her and others in mortal danger. Maddie, along with Jason and Seph, is the central emotional focus, and it is the details of their lives that make the extraordinary plot twists exciting and compelling. Fans of the first two books are sure to love this one.&#x2014;<i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But beginning in December 1884, Austin was terrorized by someone equally as vicious and, in some ways, far more diabolical than London's infamous Jack the Ripper. For almost exactly one year, the Midnight Assassin crisscrossed the entire city, striking on moonlit nights, using axes, knives, and long steel rods to rip apart women from every race and class. At the time the concept of a serial killer was unthinkable, but the murders continued, the killer became more brazen, and the citizens' panic reached a fever pitch.</p><p> Before it was all over, at least a dozen men would be arrested in connection with the murders, and the crimes would expose what a newspaper described as "the most extensive and profound scandal ever known in Austin." And yes, when Jack the Ripper began his attacks in 1888, London police investigators did wonder if the killer from Austin had crossed the ocean to terrorize their own city.</p><p> With vivid historical detail and novelistic flair, <i>Texas Monthly</i> journalist Skip Hollandsworth brings this terrifying saga to life.</p></p><p><b>Skip Hollandsworth</b> is an award-winning journalist, screenwriter, and executive editor of <i>Texas Monthly </i>magazine.

Unlike some popular works by stridently outspoken atheists, this is not a blanket condemnation of all believers. Rather the author&#39;s focus is the heartless exploitation of faithful followers by those in power, as well as sectarian intolerance, the violence against heretics and nonbelievers, and the reactionary political and economic collusion that has often prevailed between the upper echelons of church and state. Parenti notes the deleterious effects of past theocracies and the threat to our freedoms posed by present-day fundamentalists and theocratic reactionaries. He discusses how socially conscious and egalitarian minded liberal religionists have often been isolated and marginalized by their more conservative (and better financed) coreligionists. Finally, he documents the growing strength of secular freethinkers who are doing battle against the intolerant theocratic usurpers in public life.Historically anchored yet sharply focused on the contemporary scene, this eloquent indictment of religion&#39;s dangers will be welcomed by committed secular laypersons and progressive religionists alike.</p><p>Michael Parenti (Berkeley, CA) is the acclaimed author of more than twenty books, including, most recently, Contrary Notions: The Michael Parenti Reader; The Assassination of Julius Caesar; and The Culture Struggle.

A family&#x2019;s life together is troubled when the conditions that foster physical and emotional growth and well-being are continuously absent over time. The absence of these nurturing conditions has the cumulative effect of creating a childhood experience of chronic loss and abandonment. Within a family, the dynamics that create a sense of loss are denial, rigidity, isolation, and shame. Everyone will experience these things sometimes, or occasionally, but when any of these four factors are experienced to a severe degree they create an overriding sense of chronic loss. It is important to identify your losses. Until losses and pain are dealt with directly, the resulting feelings, while often masked, are carried into adulthood. Unless healthy coping skills are learned, this combination of past loss and pain leads to severe consequences creating even more pain in the present. <p>The possibility of healing is great if we allow ourselves to own our truth and garner the courage to walk through the pain. This revised edition of Changing Course (the true sequel to It Will Never Happen to Me) asks you to take action, to "get under way." It offers new exercises that will help you to begin this process. </p><p>To change course, be it a minor shift or a major turn in your life, does not mean giving up who you are, it means letting go of who you are not. It means letting go of your pain. It means letting go of an undesirable family script. </p><p>Each insight into your past and its connection to your present is like turning on the light in a dark room. It doesn&#x2019;t change what is there, but now that you can see where you are going, you can go in and out freely without harm. Fear no longer drives you. Freedom moves you. Each new awareness brings new choices. Each new awareness is a turning point. In many ways recovery is like a sailboat that "comes about," turns to a new direction and allows the wind to refill its sails. Once you change course, then you are able to harness the power of the wind &#x2014; your spiritual self. This is the journey charted in Changing Course.</p></p><p>When I wrote It Will Never Happen To Me in the early 1980&#39;s it was a major revelation for those raised with addiction. It would become the framework for understanding what it means to grow up in fear and shame and it would give a voice to those who lived in silence. It broke not only a family Don&#39;t Talk rule, it broke the cultural rule of Silence. While I have written other books, Changing Course is the true sequel to It Will Never Happen To Me.Claudia Black, M.S.W., Ph.D. is a renowned lecturer, author and trainer internationally recognized for both her pioneering and contemporary work with family systems and addictive disorders.

Historically accurate, often involving key events or figures from throughout world history, these deeply emotional novels have a devoted readership. Each novel is written as a stand-alone and they are not chronologically consecutive, so readers may enter the saga with any book and move backward or forward in time as they choose, from Pharaonic Egypt to Paris in the 1700s, from the fall of the Roman Empire to World War II Europe.</p><p>In <i>An Embarrassment of Riches</i>, the vampire Count finds himself a virtual prisoner in the Court of Kunigunde in Bohemia in the 1200s. Rakoczy Ferncsi, as Saint-Germain is known, passes his days making jewels to delight Queen Kunigunde and trying not to become involved in the Court's intrigues. In this, the vampire fails. Handsome, apparently wealthy, and obviously unmarried, he soon finds himself being sexually blackmailed by Rozsa, an ambitious lady-in-waiting. If he does not satisfy her, she will denounce him to the priests and he'll be burned at the stake, resulting in his True Death. Despite his care, the vampire makes more than one enemy at the Bohemian Court, and by the end of <i>An Embarrassment of Riches</i>, the Count can see only one road to freedom...through death.</p></p><p><p>CHELSEA QUINN YARBRO has been nominated for the Edgar, the World Fantasy, and the Bram Stoker Awards.

The two went through the arched door and into the main hall; at the far end of it was a large fireplace badly in need of sweeping; two benches lay upside down in front of it. &#x201c;We will need a staff of fifteen at least to manage this place, inside and out.&#x201d; He swung his black-and-white badger-pelt mantel off his shoulders and draped it over the nearest plank bench, revealing a black bleihaut with Hungarian-style sleeves and long, black-embroidered riding panels in the front of the garment. His Roman braccae were heavy black cotton; his high boots were thick-soled and made of tooled red leather from Aleppo. He wore no jewelry or indication of rank so as not to tempt robbers to stalk him during his travels; his head was bare, revealing dark wavy hair, cut shorter than the current fashion, with a touch of gray at the temples, and just now, his attractive, irregular features were severe. His simplicity of clothing would change when he went to the Konige&#x2019;s Court to present himself along with the rest of those subjects Konig Bela had sent to his granddaughter, when grandeur would be expected of him on account of his title; richness and variety in dress were required for members of the Konige&#x2019;s Court, and failure to present a splendid appearance would be regarded as a slight to the Konige.<br>&#x201c;More like twenty, and more for the bake-house, the bath-house, and the stable,&#x201d; said Hruther, setting the chest down and sniffing the chilly air. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s musty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True enough.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The air is stale.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It has been empty for more than a year,&#x201d; Rakoczy said, a suggestion of doubt about this in his observation. &#x201c;According to Counselor Smiricti.&#x201d;<br>The building was less than fifty years old, made of wood and stone, two stories high, with ten rooms and a kitchen in this central manse. It stood on a shoulder of a hill not far from the Vaclav Castle, surrounded by a tall stone wall; this manse was on the highest part of the mansion-grounds. The main hall reached up to the roof, heavily beamed and shadowy above the rows of shuttered windows that ran along the gallery on three sides of the hall providing what little light filtered into the room. Large as it was, the main hall was sparsely furnished with rough-hewn benches and two standing chests, both of which were open, showing all contents were gone; there was an overturned table in the far corner of the hall. To the left of the fireplace, a narrow, steep stairway led to the gallery above.<br>&#x201c;The private rooms&#x2014;six of them&#x2014;are upstairs, but for the withdrawing rooms, on the other side of the main hall,&#x201d; said Hruther as he carefully put down the bundled legs of the chest. &#x201c;According to the information we were given.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are two of those, are there not? withdrawing rooms?&#x201d; Rakoczy asked.<br>Hruther pointed to the right. &#x201c;You can see the doors; one is supposed to have three tall windows.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll decide which one of them will serve as my study; we can turn one of the upstairs rooms into my workroom, with space for my books; we will have to determine how accurate the description we were provided actually is,&#x201d; Rakoczy decided aloud. &#x201c;The work already paid for is still not done.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t quite what we expected,&#x201d; Hruther said. &#x201c;This will need a lot of work.&#x201d;<br>Rakoczy nodded his agreement. &#x201c;Fortunately we have four men from our escort with us for another ten days before they return to Santu-Germaniu. We can get some work done here until we have hired the servants we need.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Escorts and a groom,&#x201d; said Hruther of the four men who had accompanied them to Praha. He crossed the room to the maw of the fireplace. &#x201c;The chimney will need cleaning before a fire can be safely lit. At least the Bohemians have chimneys&#x2014;not like the English. By the smell of it, there are rats in the flue.&#x201d; He glanced at the floor. &#x201c;By the droppings, there are rats everywhere.&#x201d;<br>Although it was April, the day was overcast, threatening rain, so the house was chilly and damp. Hruther stretched to ease his shoulders. &#x201c;The eight wagons with your furnishings should be here in a few days. It was wise to dispatch them separately; I think now you were right about that. Konig Bela would have been suspicious of you taking so many of our own goods with the Dux of Oradea&#x2019;s escort. Bela would like your exile to be as limited as possible, but since he needs Santu-Germaniu to help keep his heir in check in Transylvania, he cannot deny you at least a few of your things. Bela has good reason to contain Istvan, and without Santu-Germaniu he won&#x2019;t be able to.&#x201d; He looked at the nearest of the open chests, shaking his head. &#x201c;We can manage for four days on our own. You have enough gold to hire help before the rest of your goods arrive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you dare to speak the heir&#x2019;s name aloud?&#x201d; Rakoczy asked, his tone gently mocking.<br>&#x201c;Who but you can hear me, my master?&#x201d; Hruther countered. &#x201c;I will say nothing that could create more suspicions than have already accumulated around us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We may yet need my gold for bribes, though Bohemia is rich in gold.&#x201d;<br>Hruther gave a wintery smile. &#x201c;Jewels will be most welcome, in any event. The Konige will want them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wish I had been allowed more of my servants to come with me,&#x201d; Rakoczy said, taking a turn about the main hall, feeling increasingly desolate as he took stock of all the work to be done. &#x201c;There is so much to be restored.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True enough,&#x201d; Hruther agreed.<br>&#x201c;As you say, we can probably manage well enough until the household goods arrive. This is hardly the Silk Road, nor is it Leosan Fortress, or Cyprus, thank all the forgotten gods.&#x201d; Memories of those three places rose in his thoughts; he looked toward the maw of the fireplace as the images faded.<br>Hruther pinched the bridge of his nose, then rubbed his eyes, doing his best to banish the fatigue that was taking hold of him now that they had reached the end of their journey. &#x201c;The Dux set a hard pace for us,&#x201d; he said as if offering an explanation for his weariness. &#x201c;Doubtless Konig Bela required it of him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he did,&#x201d; Rakoczy said.<br>&#x201c;Still, we should make some effort to settle in as soon as your goods arrive,&#x201d; Hruther declared, making himself stand straight. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s expected. The Konige&#x2019;s Court will expect it of you.&#x201d; He stretched his arms, laced his fingers, and pushed his hands out ahead of him.<br>&#x201c;We should probably fetch food from the market before that; as you say, it is expected and the men are hungry,&#x201d; Rakoczy said, and then added, &#x201c;Or I could give them money for a meal and entertainment. What do you think, old friend?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d probably prefer the latter, and it will postpone our first visit to the market until tomorrow; I can wait until then to purchase a lamb or a brace of ducks for my own needs,&#x201d; said Hruther. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long trek from your native earth. The men have earned their respite&#x2014;no doubt they&#x2019;ll be glad of a night of revelry and soft beds.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then they shall have such a night, and as many of them as we may need to provide,&#x201d; Rakoczy nodded, and continued his stroll around the room. &#x201c;We should purchase a proper table from the local wood-workers, with chairs, not benches, to go with it. The servants&#x2019; quarters are behind the kitchen opposite the stable, as I recall from the Counselor&#x2019;s description.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go and look, if you like,&#x201d; Hruther offered.<br>Rakoczy laughed once. &#x201c;You have the right of it; neither of us has been here before, and we are both seeing it for the first time. That plan the Counselors sent has its limits in&#x2014;&#x201d; He paused, pondering for a moment. &#x201c;I suppose I should send a gift to the Counselors of Praha for selecting this place for us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They probably expect something for their help,&#x201d; Hruther agreed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be time enough tomorrow to present yourself to them, when you can report your plans for this place.&#x201d; He pointed to the empty sconces on the wall. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need some torches by nightfall. We don&#x2019;t want to fumble about in the dark.&#x201d;<br>Rakoczy nodded. &#x201c;And not fumbling about would lead to awkward questions,&#x201d; he said; he saw nearly as well in the dark as he did in daylight. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put incense in the sap on the torches, to take the disused odor out of the air.&#x201d;<br>Hruther moved to the center of the main hall, taking stock of the place. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bit drafty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We will have to find where the drafts are worst and hang tapestries there until proper caulking can be done.&#x201d; Rakoczy sighed. &#x201c;Do you suppose we should send a messenger to the Konige&#x2019;s Court to announce our arrival? Or is that the Counselors&#x2019; duty?&#x201d; He stopped. &#x201c;You have no more notion than I do. I am speaking to the walls as much as to you, for which I ask your pardon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You needn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Hruther; his faded-blue eyes showed a trace of amusement. &#x201c;There are busy days ahead of us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Truly,&#x201d; said Rakoczy. He strode to the staircase next to the fireplace. &#x201c;I trust the Counselors will advise us on where we might find dependable servants.

Bush Air National Guard controversy, new insights on the JFK assassination, the origin of "Hurricane Dan" as well as inside stories about all the U.S. Presidents he covered and all the top personalities Dan has either interviewed or worked with over his distinguished career. <br><br>The book will also include Dan's thoughts on the state of journalism today and what he sees for its future, as well as never-before-revealed personal observations and commentary.<br></p><p>Dan Rather is an award winning journalist who anchored CBS Evening News for decades. He is one of America&#39;s most decorated news journalists of all time.A renowned journalist settles scores in this investigation of how the news media has become dangerously intertwined with politics and corporate interests.<br><br>With the assistance of Diehl, Rather (The American Dream: Stories from the Heart of Our Nation, 2002 etc.) comes out swinging as he delves into the circumstances behind his firing from CBS News, where he had worked as a reporter since 1962, covering everything from Vietnam to Watergate to the conditions at Abu Ghraib. Unfortunately for Rather, his determination to air a potentially damning story about then-president George W. Bush's spotty military record irked the higher-ups at CBS's parent company, Viacom, leaving the feisty anchor unemployed at 75. Never one to shirk controversy, he sued CBS for breach of contract; although the suit was dismissed before it could come to trial, he has no regrets and no qualms about naming names. Indeed, this memoir reads as a muckraker's delight, with Rather lambasting CBS management as "spineless" and "risk-averse." He painstakingly details the cloak-and-dagger operations that Bush proponents resorted to in an attempt to hide the truth and discredit Rather's source materials. Invoking Edward R. Murrow, Rather rails against those who would distort the news for their own gain and intentionally mislead the public. In between, he provides fair-minded portraits of the presidents he has interviewed, traces his passion for the news to his upbringing in a news-savvy family and expresses concern for the future of independent media in an industry that is increasingly kowtowing to the almighty bottom line. While Rather occasionally lapses into platitudes-a chapter on 9/11 offers little beyond well-worn observations about courage and patriotism-he always gives credit where credit is due, and his sincerity is never in doubt.<br><br>An engaging grab-bag: part folksy homage to roots, part expos? of institutional wrongdoing and part manifesto for a truly free press.<br>-- Kirkus Reviews<br>Anchor of the CBS Evening News for 24 years, much-honored newsman Rather has been working as a reporter for 64 years. He began his series of memoirs with The Camera Never Blinks (1977), a bestseller spanning his life from journalism study at Sam Houston State Teachers College to Watergate. He followed with I Remember (1991), recalling his Texas childhood, and The Camera Never Blinks Twice (1994) about TV journalism on location from Afghanistan to Vietnam. In this latest update to the series, his straight arrow honesty is punctuated with occasional humor: "It was long said of me that I had the CBS Eye tattooed somewhere on my ass." For a blistering opening chapter, he details the "absence of executive backbone" during CBS News' investigation of Abu Gharib: "The possibility that the financial and political interests of CBS corporate almost buried a story as compelling as Abu Gharib is most unsettling." He's equally outspoken on the "journalistic meltdown" when CBS News was ordered to drop its investigation into Bush's experience with the Texas Air National Guard. Throughout the book he delivers strong punches at those who stood in his way, but he also has much praise for the co-workers who joined him in his quest for the truth. With his usual conversational writing style, he maintains a personal connection with his readers in this riveting and revelatory autobiography that can also serve as a valuable textbook for anyone studying journalism.<br>--Publisher's Weekly<br><br></p><h2>The Templar&#39;s Secret Island , The Knights, The Priest and the Treasure (Bornholm, Denmark )</h2><p>Does the remote Baltic island of Bornholm hold the key to an ancient secret?

In this evocative new book, a distinguished writer and a renowned photographer collaborate to give us a unique vision of that gilded past. Deborah Turbeville&#39;s stunning photographs convey the glory and the mystery of some of the great estates, inside and out. Adding an historical angle, Louis Auchincloss gives keen and witty observations of society, its leaders and architects, and social customs of the period.</p><p>Newport, Rhode Island, was America's version of the nineteenth-century European haut bourgeois resort full of grand homes, grander landscapes, and architectural motifs lifted from earlier history. Louis Auchincloss' long introduction to Turbeville's pictures gives a clear account of Newport's history and what made it such a magnet to some of this country's wealthiest citizens. Artists and writers were valued participants in Newport life: Henry James was a young arrival (although not yet, of course, a novelist) in 1858 who waxed enthusiastic over an invitation into the literary parlor of Julia Ward Howe. Turbeville's soft-focused and pastel-colored or sepia photographs--which often include models dressed in nineteenth-century clothing styles and are deliberately given an aged appearance--hauntingly, beautifully conjure the past, and with an air of informality or studiedly antique formality that makes them seem both finished work and pictures whose exact themes are still being worked on. This is a book lovely enough for the art collection, historical enough for the American studies shelves. <i>Ra{�}ul Ni{�}no</i></p><h2>Fundamentals of Catholicism, Vol. 2: God, Trinity, Creation, Christ, Mary</h2><p>New book with some slight shelf wear.

The three divorc�es&#x2014;Alexandra, Jane, and Sukie&#x2014;have left town, remarried, and become widows. They cope with their grief and solitude as widows do: they travel the world, to such foreign lands as Canada, Egypt, and China, and renew old acquaintance. Why not, Sukie and Jane ask Alexandra, go back to Eastwick for the summer? The old Rhode Island seaside town, where they indulged in wicked mischief under the influence of the diabolical Darryl Van Horne, is still magical for them. Now Darryl is gone, and their lovers of the time have aged or died, but enchantment remains in the familiar streets and scenery of the village, where they enjoyed their lusty primes as free and empowered women. And, among the local citizenry, there are still those who remember them, and wish them ill. How they cope with the lingering traces of their evil deeds, the shocks of a mysterious counterspell, and the advancing inroads of old age, form the burden on Updike&#x2019;s delightful, ominous sequel.</p><p>John Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954 and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> and since 1957 has lived in Massachusetts. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal.i. The Coven ReconstitutedThose of us acquainted with their sordid and scandalous story were not surprised to hear, by way of rumors from the various localities where the sorceresses had settled after fleeing our venerable town of Eastwick, Rhode Island, that the husbands whom the three Godforsaken women had by their dark arts concocted for themselves did not prove durable. Wicked methods make weak products. Satan counterfeits Creation, yes, but with inferior goods.Alexandra, the oldest in age, the broadest in body, and the nearest in character to normal, generous-spirited humanity, was the first to become a widow. Her instinct, as with so many a wife suddenly liberated into solitude, was to travel&#x2014;as if the world at large, by way of flimsy boarding cards and tedious airport delays and the faint but undeniable risk of flight in a time of rising fuel costs, airline bankruptcy, suicidal terrorists, and accumulating metal fatigue, could be compelled to yield the fruitful aggravation of having a mate. Jim Farlander, the husband she had conjured for herself from a hollowed pumpkin, a cowboy hat, and a pinch of Western soil scraped from inside the back fender of a pickup truck with Colorado plates that she had seen parked, looking eerily out of place, on Oak Street in the early 1970s, had, as their marriage settled and hardened, proved difficult to budge from his ceramics studio and little-frequented pottery shop on a side street in Taos, New Mexico.Jim&#x2019;s idea of a trip had been the hour&#x2019;s drive south to Santa Fe; his idea of a holiday was spending a day in one of the Indian reservations&#x2014;Navajo, Zuni, Apache, Acoma, Isleta Pueblo&#x2014;spying out what the Native American potters were offering in the reservation souvenir shops, and hoping to pick up cheap in some dusty Indian Bureau commissary an authentic old black-and-white geometric Pueblo jar or a red-on-buff Hohokam storage jar, with its spiral-and-maze pattern, which he could peddle for a small fortune to a newly endowed museum in one of the burgeoning resort cities of the Southwest. Jim liked where he was, and Alexandra liked that in him, since she as his wife was part of where he was. She liked his lean build (a flat stomach to the day he died, and never performed a sit-up in his life) and the saddle smell of his sweat and the scent of clay that clung, like a sepia aura, to his strong and knowing hands. They had met, on the natural plane, when she, for some time divorced, had taken a course at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he had been enlisted as a fill-in instructor. The four stepchildren&#x2014;Marcy, Ben, Linda, Eric&#x2014;that she saddled him with couldn&#x2019;t have asked for a calmer, more soothingly taciturn father-substitute. He was easier for her children&#x2014;half out of the nest in any case, Marcy being all of eighteen&#x2014;to relate to than their own father, Oswald Spofford, a small manufacturer of kitchen fixtures from Norwich, Connecticut. Poor Ozzie had become so earnestly involved in Little League baseball and company bowling that no one, not even his children, could take him seriously.People had taken Jim Farlander seriously, women and children especially, giving him back his own coiled silence. His level gray eyes had the glint of a gun from within the shade of his wide-brimmed hat, its crown darkened where his thumb and fingers pinched it. When he was at the pottery wheel he tied a faded blue bandana around his head to keep his long hair&#x2014;gray but still streaked with its original sun-bleached auburn and gathered behind into an eight-inch ponytail&#x2014;out of the clay, wet and spinning on the foot-powered wheel. A fall in his teens from a horse had left him with a limp, and the wheel, which he refused to electrify, limped with him, while out of the spinning his masculine hands shaped blobs upward into graceful vessels with slender waists and swelling bottoms.It was in bed she first felt his death coming. His erections began to wilt just as she might have come if he had held on; instead, in his body upon hers, there was a palpable loosening in the knit of his sinews. There had been a challenging nicety in the taut way Jim dressed himself&#x2014;pointy vanilla-colored boots, butt-hugging jeans with rivet-bordered pockets, and crisp checked shirts double-buttoned at the cuff. Once a dandy of his type, he began to wear the same shirt two and even three days in a row. His jaw showed shadows of white whisker underneath, from careless shaving or troubled eyesight. When the ominous blood counts began to arrive from the hospital, and the shadows in the X-rays were visible to even her untrained eyes, he greeted the news with stoic lassitude; Alexandra had to fight to get him out of his crusty work clothes into something decent. They had joined the legion of elderly couples who fill hospital waiting rooms, as quiet with nervousness as parents and children before a recital. She felt the other couples idly pawing at them with their eyes, trying to guess which of the two was the sick one, the doomed one; she didn&#x2019;t want it to be obvious. She wanted to present Jim as a mother presents a child going to school for the first time, as a credit to her. They had lived, these thirty-plus years since she had lived in Eastwick, by their own rules, up in Taos; there the free spirits of the Lawrences and Mabel Dodge Luhan still cast a sheltering cachet over the remnant tribe of artistic wannabes, a hard-drinking, New Age&#x2013;superstitious, artsy-craftsy crowd who aimed their artifacts, in their shop-window displays, more and more plaintively at scrimping, low-brow tourists rather than the well-heeled local collectors of Southwestern art. Alexandra for a time had revived her manufacture of little ceramic &#x201c;bubbies&#x201d;&#x2014;faceless, footless little female figures, pleasant to hold in the hand and roughly painted in clothes worn as close to the skin as tattoos&#x2014;but Jim, jealous and dictatorial in his art as true artists are, had been less than gracious about sharing his kiln. In any case, the miniature women, their vulval cleft boldly dented into the clay with a toothpick or nail file held sideways, belonged to an uncomfortable prior period of her life, when she had practiced, with two other Rhode Island divorcees, a half-baked suburban variety of witchcraft.Jim&#x2019;s illness drove her and Jim down from safe, arty Taos into the wider society, the valleys of the ailing, a vast herd moving like stampeded bison toward the killing cliff. The socialization forced upon her&#x2014;interviews with doctors, most of them unsettlingly young; encounters with nurses, demanding merciful attentions the hospitalized patient was too manly and depressed to ask for himself; commisera- tion with others in her condition, soon-to-be widows and widowers she would have shunned on the street but now, in these antiseptic hallways, embraced with shared tears&#x2014;prepared her for travel in the company of strangers.She could not believe it&#x2014;how totally Jim was gone, his morning absence as vivid as a rooster&#x2019;s wake-up crow, his evening non-appearance a refusal bound, she felt, to be cancelled, any moment, by the scuffling sound of his boots limping across the entry hall or the squeak, two rooms away, of his potter&#x2019;s wheel. Three months after his death, she signed up for a ten-day tour of the Canadian Rockies. Her old, married, cosseted self, a bohemian snob proud of her careless, mannish clothes and high-desert privacy, would have sneered at the feigned camaraderie of an organized group tour. She foresaw the daily duty to rise and gorge on cafeteria-style hotel breakfasts and submit to more marvels, and the resisted but irresistible naps in the swaying bus in clammy proximity to an alien body, usually that of another plucky widow, overweight and remorselessly talkative. Then there would be the sleepless hours, amid worrisome small noises and mysterious tiny red lights, in a king-size bed built for a couple. Hotel pillows were always too stuffed, too full, and lifted her head too high, so she woke, groggily dumfounded to have slept at all, with a stiff neck. The pillow next to hers would be undented. It would dawn on her that she would never be one of a couple again.But, born in Colorado, she thought it an amusing idea to follow the Rockies north into another country, where a dramatic landscape did not flatter the rapacious vanity of the United States. And Canada, she discovered, did have its good points: airports not bribed to install television sets pouring forth an inescapable babble, and voices whose familiar North American accent was braced by a few leftover Scots vowels, and a gray imperial gravity of public architecture. This national identity had been created by the sensible spirit of business enterprise, linking the provinces like great beads on an iron railroad line, rather than by any evangelical preachment of a Manifest Destiny&#x2014;manifest only to its Anglo perpetrators&#x2014;that had hurled the agglutinated United States westwards and then outwards, across all the oceans, where its boy soldiers lost limbs and died. The daily death-tolls from Iraq were worth escaping.On the other hand, in Canada hotel restaurants still seemed to think Frank Sinatra and Nat &#x201c;King&#x201d; Cole the latest thing in background music, and the giant cruise ships docked in Vancouver were headed off to dreary cold Alaska. Canada, its tundra and icefields and miles of forest pressing its population down tight against the forty-ninth parallel, had in self-defense embraced Green-ness, trying to make a pet of it, mining for tourist dollars the nostalgia and righteousness inherent in its cause. Bring Back Nature&#x2014;who could object to that? But for Alexandra, totem poles and emblematic moose had a basic boringness. She felt, up here, trapped in an attic of stuffed animals. Nature had been her ally in witchcraft, but still she distrusted it, as a conscienceless killer, spendthrift and blind.After a day in Vancouver, and another in determinedly quaint Victoria, the tour&#x2014;forty travellers, none of them young and eight of them Australian&#x2014;boarded a sleeper train and were dragged northwards through the dark. They woke amid mountains dazzling with the yellow of turning aspens. The tour had reserved a viewing car for their party, and Alexandra, hesitantly entering, after a heavy breakfast fetched by lurching waiters in the dining car, was greeted with hesitant smiles from the already seated couples. She took one of the few seats left and was conscious of the vacancy at her side, as if of a monstrous wen throwing her face off balance.But, then, she could never have talked Jim into coming on such an adventure. He hated foreign countries, even the Virgin Islands, where, a few times early in their marriage, she had persuaded him to take her, as a break from the long Taos winter and the ski-season traffic jams along Route 522. They had arrived in St. Thomas, as it turned out, in the late afternoon, and were caught, in their rented Volkswagen Beetle, in the evening rush hour, Jim trying to drive for the first time in his life on the wrong side of the road. More unfortunately still, they were surrounded by black drivers who took a racist pleasure in tailgating them and in rebuking every sign of automotive uncertainty with prolonged, indignant honking. Though eventually they found the resort, at the end of a poorly marked road, Jim got sunburned the first day, having scorned her repeated offer of sunscreen, and then got deadly sick on some conch salad. Whenever, ever after, he felt bested in an exchange of accusations, he would remind her, in detail, of that week that almost--twenty-five years before he really died--killed him.Now, in Canada, there was not a road or car in sight, just the tracks and tunnels ahead as the train bored upward through mountains splashed with quaking golden leaves. "There's Mount Robson!" a woman behind Alexandra excitedly told her husband.An Australian across the aisle, in an attempt at friendliness, said to Alexandra, "Mount Robson ahead," as if she were deaf as well as alone.From behind this speaker, another voice--not Australian, less peppy, with a tinge of the American Southern tinge--explained to her, everybody around her suddenly solicitous, as if of a defective in their midst, "The tallest peak in the Canadian Rockies.""Really? Already?" Alexandra asked, knowing she sounded stupid and covering herself with "I mean, shouldn't they have saved it for later in the tour?"Nobody laughed, perhaps not hearing, or understanding, her little joke. The train was taking a long curve, and the gleaming mountain-tip sank from view behind the aspens; the peak had been oddly regular, like a pyramid in a set of child's blocks, but white. "How high is it?" she asked aloud, determined to combat her sense of non-existence.Again, she had struck a silencing note. "Nearly four thousand meters," an Australian voice volunteered.She had trouble translating out of the metric system, and, borrowing a bit of her late husband's xenophobia, refused to try. The slightly Southern voice understood, and explained, "Nearly thirteen thousand feet, ma'am.""My goodness!" Alexandra said, beginning to enjoy her own inanity. She turned her head to look at her informant. He was lanky, like Jim, and lean-faced, with deep creases and a mustache just long enough to droop. His costume, too-- faded tight blue jeans and a long-sleeved red-checked shirt-- reminded her of Jim. "<i>Thank </i>you," she said, with more warmth than she had strictly intended. Perhaps this man with his air of dignified sorrow was a widower. Or was waiting for some slow-moving wife to join him here in the viewing car. "Mount Robson isn't on the tour," the wife behind Alexandra was saying in her ear, in a penetrating, slightly vexed voice. "It's in a separate national park from Jasper.""I really haven't done my homework," Alexandra apologized, backwards, experiencing a flash of hatred--the old impatient, witchy, bug-zapping kind of hate she thought she had long outgrown. Why should this woman, common and shrewish from the sound of her voice, have a live husband, when she, Alexandra, did not, sitting here exposed on all sides to these well-meant interventions from strangers?"That's my style, too," a male Australian reassured her."Learn as you go. It's my wife reads the books ahead.""And sees to the tickets and passports, you lazy sod," the wife said, in the humorous tone of a practiced complaint.The train, smoother-running than American trains, on Canadian National Railway tracks welded and upheld by the government, continued to nose skyward. Mount Robson again appeared above the trees, its whiteness marked now by black striations--by snow-striped patches, faceted as if the peak had been carved to a point like a flint weapon. The hard cobalt of a picture-postcard sky pressed on these concave contours until the peak disappeared again behind the waves of yellow leaves. "It says here," the Australian wife loudly announced, holding a guidebook, "it was first climbed in 1913, by an Austrian bloke named Kain. K-A-I-N. It says the Canadian mountain men didn't like it when foreigners were the first to climb their mountains to the top. Got their ruddy noses out of joint."Alexandra sighed and closed her lids, excusing herself from hearing any more. She wanted to relieve them all of having to pay her any further attention. Being a big woman, tall and somewhat broad, her full head of chestnut-brown hair still only half white, had given her a presence when she was younger but now that she was old and mateless made her conspicuous, an embarrassment to herself. <i>Kain, Cain, </i>she thought. The first man to do a truly wicked deed, worse even than eating the apple of knowledge. Slew his brother, Abel. Thirty years ago Alexandra had slain a sister witch: she and Sukie Rougemont and Jane Smart had killed little Jenny Gabriel, though the death certificate blamed metastasized malignancy of the ovaries. The curse of it was always there, inside Alexandra, eve...</p><h2>Touchpoints: Your Child&#39;s Emotional and Behavioral Development, Birth to 3 -- The Essential Reference for the Early Years</h2><p>Based on over three decades of continuous practice and internationally recognized research, <i>Touchpoints </i> is the only childcare reference by a pediatrician who has both medical and psychoanalytic training, and who offers parents a complete understanding of child development from a physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral point of view.

Beginning in the eleventh century and ending as late as the eighteenth, these holy wars were waged against Muslims and other enemies of the Church, enlisting generations of laymen and laywomen to fight for the sake of Christendom.<br><br>Crusading features prominently in today's religio-political hostilities, yet the perceptions of these wars held by Arab nationalists, pan-Islamists, and many in the West have been deeply distorted by the language and imagery of nineteenth-century European imperialism. With this book, Jonathan Riley-Smith returns to the actual story of the Crusades, explaining why and where they were fought and how deeply their narratives and symbolism became embedded in popular Catholic thought and devotional life. <br><br>From this history, Riley-Smith traces the legacy of the Crusades into modern times, specifically within the attitudes of European imperialists and colonialists and within the beliefs of twentieth-century Muslims. Europeans fashioned an interpretation of the Crusades from the writings of Walter Scott and a French contemporary, Joseph-Fran�ois Michaud. Scott portrayed Islamic societies as forward-thinking, while casting Christian crusaders as culturally backward and often morally corrupt. Michaud, in contrast, glorified crusading, and his followers used its imagery to illuminate imperial adventures. <br><br>These depictions have had a profound influence on contemporary Western opinion, as well as on Muslim attitudes toward their past and present. Whether regarded as a valid expression of Christianity's divine enterprise or condemned as a weapon of empire, crusading has been a powerful rhetorical tool for centuries. In order to understand the preoccupations of Islamist jihadis and the character of Western discourse on the Middle East, Riley-Smith argues, we must understand how images of crusading were formed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p>Jonathan Riley-Smith, Dixie Professor Emeritus of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge, is the author of nine books, including <i>The Knights of St. John in Jerusalem and Cyprus, c. 1050&#x2013;1310</i>; <i>The Feudal Nobility and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1174&#x2013;1277</i>; <i>What Were the Crusades?</i> fourth edition; <i>The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading</i>; <i>The Crusades: A History</i>, second edition; <i>The First Crusaders, 1095&#x2013;1131</i>; and <i>Templars and Hospitallers as Professed Religious in the Holy Land</i>.<p>Read the this excerpt in pdf format | Copyright information <strong>Introduction </strong></p> <p>The First Crusade was fought between 1096 and 1102. The crusading movement was at its most popular from the late twelfth century to the late fourteenth, but was still active in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The last crusade league was the Holy League, which began the recovery of the Balkans from the Turks between 1684 and 1699. The last operative order-state of a military order was Hospitaller Malta, which succumbed to Napoleon in 1798. A new military order was founded as late as 1890, although it had a very short life, as we will see. We are faced by a movement that lasted for hundreds of years and touched the lives of the ancestors of everyone today of Western European descent and of many of Eastern European, Jewish, and Muslim descent as well. No one can feel comfortable about this aspect of our collective experience, but for intellectual as well as moral reasons the role of its historians is an awkward one. In the last thirty years their understanding of the movement has led them to reject the long-held belief that it was defined solely by its theaters of operation in the Levant and its hostility toward Islam�with the consequence that in their eyes the Muslims move slightly off center stage�and many of them have begun to face up to the ideas and motivation of the crusaders. The more they do so the more they find themselves <i>contra mundum</i> or, at least, <i>contra mundum Christianum</i>, because their conception of the realities of crusading turns out to be in conflict with those of nearly everyone else, from leading churchmen and scholars in other fields to the general public.</p> <p>In many ways the Crusades deserve their poor reputation. Like all religious wars, they were marked by indiscipline and atrocities. As military expeditions that were also pilgrimages, they had to be open to all, sinners as well as saints�especially sinners�and there was no system for screening volunteers to identify the unsuitable, who might include psychopaths. The popes, who authorized them, lost control once the armies were on the march, and the fact that the laymen who were entrusted with leadership in the field were volunteers made adequate chains of command hard to establish. The methods employed to encourage recruitment heightened emotions in men who could then be exposed to tension and alienation for very long periods of time. Although it is hard to draw lessons from modern combat psychiatry and apply them to situations hundreds of years ago, it is known that volunteers are more likely to commit atrocities than con�scripts and that over-long exposure to stress is bad for efficiency and discipline.</p> <p>Measures assuring greater cohesion and control began to be adopted in the thirteenth century. The crusaders bound for the Levant were being transported by sea, which reduced the number of noncombatants, since the poor could not afford a maritime passage, and forced the planners to think about logistics, which were less problematic now that the armies were not encumbered by hordes of the unsuitable. The decision of the papacy to raise large sums from the taxation of the church, which were then allotted to those leaders who were taking the cross, provided a means of subsidizing crusaders through their commanders and therefore of making them more ame�nable, while the introduction from the 1330s onward of crusade leagues enabled the states in these alliances to make use of their "regular" forces (if one can use that term), combining the benefits of crusading with more professional fighting elements. A huge gulf separates the scratch forces of the twelfth century from the Christian navy, which fought the battle of Lepanto in 1571, or the armies of the Holy League, which were recovering Hungary in the 1680s.</p> <p>There was obviously more to crusading in the central Middle Ages than cruelty and indiscipline, but nothing can eradicate from present-day minds the impression left by those unruly armies. Among the descendants of those who perceive themselves to have been damaged by them, the Muslims and the Greek Orthodox have developed mythistories�to use a word adopted by Dr. Gary Dickson in another context�in which memories of genuine injuries have been embroidered, even re-created, long after the events concerned. The perception most modern Muslims have of the Crusades dates only from the end of the nineteenth century, as we shall see. It constituted, in fact, a transference onto the past of feelings of alienation engendered by imperialism. In the case of the Greeks it was the failure of the West to come to the assistance of the rump of the Byzantine empire in 1453�two and a half centuries after the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade�and resentment building up during the long years of subjection to the Ottomans that seem to have fanned the bitterness, although it is true that the Greek church had suffered from its refusal to reconcile itself with Latin Christianity on papal terms.</p> <p>The modern reactions of the Jews, who have more right than the members of any other community to consider themselves to have been the innocent victims of the crusaders, are more complex. Pogroms marked the departure of many of the Crusades to the East in the central Middle Ages and the Jews, who memorialized their suf�ferings in the Ashkenazi liturgy, have naturally been inclined to link them to the Holocaust of the 1940s through a chain of terrible events extending over eight and a half centuries. In the last thirty years, however, a more focused approach has emerged among historians of the early persecutions, while those Israelis who are interested in the settlements the crusaders established in the East treat them much more positively than they did in the past, demonstrating how strongly modern priorities are echoed in interpretations of history. The establishment of the state of Israel on much of the territory occupied by the "crusader" kingdom of Jerusalem has led to scholarly and popular engagement with the kingdom's history and institutions. These used to be compared very unfavorably with the achievements of modern Zionism, but they are now being portrayed in a better light. Even quite minor "crusader" sites in Israel are being developed as tourist centers, while Professor Ronnie Ellenblum has traced a progression:</p> <p>"from the "Jewish" reading of its history, focusing on the slaughter of the Rhineland Jewish communities in 1096, to a Zionist reading of the crusades, focusing on seeing them as an inverse prefiguration of the future Zionist movement, and finally to a reading of the crusades as part of my own country, and to a certain degree, as part of my own history."</p> <p>On the other hand, leading Christian churchmen in the Western tradition�Catholic and Protestant�are not only ashamed by the fact of the Crusades but are also in a state of self-denial. Embarrassed by this aspect of their past, they have underplayed its importance in their history, while maintaining that it really had very little to do with their religion. In a recent lecture the archbishop of Canterbury stated that "Most Christians would now say that... the crusades... were serious betrayals of many of the central beliefs of the Christian faith." He was echoed by the professor of the History of the Church in Oxford, who asserted that the Crusades constituted "a bizarre centuries-long episode in which western Christianity wilfully ignored its Master's principles of love and forgiveness." Pope John Paul II, who never apologized for the Crusades but gave the impression that he was doing so, would probably have agreed. The issue I have with these leading representatives of the consensus relates not to their theology but to their knowledge of history, because underlying their opinions is the belief that the crusading movement was an aberration, a departure from the norm in Christian history.</p> <p>This is wish-fulfillment, stemming from a desire to reshape the past of one's religion into a more acceptable form. As recently as the seventeenth century, and perhaps more recently still, most Christians�Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant�had in general no problem with the idea of holy war. From the twelfth century to the seventeenth the consensus of the teaching of the Catholic bishops was that qualified men had a moral obligation to take the cross. This was reinforced by the support of a succession of men and women generally recognized as saints: Bernard of Clairvaux, Dominic, Louis of France, Thomas Aquinas, Bridget of Sweden, Catherine of Siena, John of Capistrano, even probably Francis of Assisi. From Urban II in 1095 to Innocent XI in 1684, pope after pope wrote, or authorized the dispatch of, letters in which the faithful were summoned to crusade, offered spiritual privileges if they responded and threatened with divine judgment if they did not, and the papacy recognized a new type of religious institute in approving of and privileging the military orders. At least six general councils of the church legislated for crusades and two of them, the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) and the Second Council of Lyons (1274), published the constitutions <i>Ad liberandam</i> and <i>Pro zelo fidei</i>, which were among the movement's defining documents. The early Protestants' rejection of the papal magisterium and salvation through works did not prevent them preaching the right of Christians to take up arms in their own defense against the Turks, and it has been pointed out that Martin Luther's approach "resem�bled the Catholic crusade in a number of key respects, notably its emphasis on repentance and prayer." The Huguenot captain Francis of La Noue wrote in the early 1580s a proposal for a modified cru�sade, without an indulgence, to recover Constantinople.</p> <p>It should also be remembered that no crusade could ever have left Europe merely because a pope had authorized it or a general council had issued some declaration concerning it. Crusaders were on the whole volunteers and this meant that the laity...</p></p><h2>Judah P. Benjamin - The Jewish Confederate</h2><p>Traces the life of Benjamin, the first Jewish U.S. Senator, and the Confederate Secretary of State, and describes his exile in England</p><p>This well-written and well-researched volume replaces Robert Meade's biography (1943) as the standard study and is a significant contribution both to Southern Jewish and Civil War history. Unlike previous biographers, Evans sees Jewishness as the key to understanding Benjamin's life. He also traces in fascinating detail Benjamin's relationship with Jefferson Davis. Sometimes, Evans moves beyond the available evidence, e.g. when he adduces Jewish reasons for Benjamin's flight, and argues that in the wake of the Lincoln assassination "a nation of Christ-haunted people searched instinctively for the Jewish scapegoat." Nevertheless, this is highly convincing overall. For most libraries. Jonathan D.

So when Lord Artos--later known as King Arthur--needs an interpreter to help him buy large horses to breed a troop strong enough to carry armed warriors against the Saxon invaders, Galwyn gets a chance to redeem his father&#x2019;s honor and make a name for himself. &#x201c;The wonderful horse lore, the great and charismatic figure of Arthur, and the sympathetic hero all come together to make an engrossing and realistic Arthurian novel.&#x201d;--<i>The Horn Book</i><br></p><p>Anne McCaffrey is back with this precious, well-researched yarn that follows a Celtic lad in service to King Arthur. Set in fifth-century Britain, McCaffrey's first historical novel for young adults rejects a fantastical, Hollywood treatment of King Arthur in favor of realism and solid storytelling. Take away the Round Table and the usual knights-in-shining-armor hoo-hah, and you're left with an engaging, endearing chapter from the life of Artos, <i>Comes Britannorum</i>, a young war leader in search of horses strong enough to carry his armored warriors into battle against the savage Saxons.<p> The story is told through the eyes of polite, earnest young do-gooder Galwyn Varianus, who has fled the service of his cruel, brutish, seafaring uncle to take up with the charismatic Artos. Galwyn quickly proves his value with his affinity for languages and horses, and he accompanies Artos and the <i>Companions</i> (proto-Knights of the Round Table) as they execute their plan: acquiring and then breeding a handful of fabled <i>Libyans</i>, the horses of the book's title, and then mastering and disseminating the knowledge of horseshoe-making. The action revolves around Galwyn's role in this plan and never rises above the pace of, say, an after-school special. But rich details, McCaffrey's obvious love of the subject matter, and involving characters go a long way to make up for the story's slow trot. (In particular, you'll find yourself waiting eagerly for the comeuppance of one character, a sneering rider named Iswy, Goofus to Galwyn's Gallant.) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Anne McCaffrey is best known for the dragons she invented in her Dragonriders of Pern series. What many people don't know is that her first love was for horses--and it still is! A number of years ago, she realized her dream of building a horse farm, and each year I go to visit her in Ireland, I see improvements and get the guided tour of all the horses. This last visit, Anne showed me where some of her most beloved horses are buried--and I was moved at how choked up she got just pointing out the spot (and a gorgeous spot it is, too, with views across the fields down to the Irish Sea). So it was no surprise to me when Anne wrote Black Horses for the King, a tale of King Arthur from the point of view of the boy who helped him build his cavalry and brought the art of farriery (shoeing horses, for those who aren't familiar with the term) to the British Isles. Anne even ran her own farriery school in Ireland for a while. So I know that the details in this book are correct, and the subject is about as near and dear to the author's heart as one could get.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor<br></p><h2>Sycamore Row Large Print</h2><p>John Grisham takes you back to where it all began . . . John Grisham&#39;s A Time to Kill is one of the most popular novels of our time. Now we return to that famous courthouse in Clanton as Jake Brigance once again finds himself embroiled in a fiercely controversial trial-a trial that will expose old racial tensions and force Ford County to confront its tortured history. Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten, will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County&#39;s most notorious citizens, just three years earlier. The second will raises far more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row? In Sycamore Row, John Grisham returns to the setting and the compelling characters that first established him as America&#39;s favorite storyteller. Here, in his most assured and thrilling novel yet, is a powerful testament to the fact that Grisham remains the master of the legal thriller, nearly twenty-five years after the publication of A Time to Kill.</p><p></p><h2>Quiet Thunder (Journeys of the Stranger #6)</h2><p>In the sixth installment of the Journeys of the Stranger series, legendary hero John Stranger becomes involved in the lives of a brave and skillful Sioux warrior named Quiet Thunder and the white Army captain who has been his blood brother since childhood.

The best place to sheathe a blade is in your enemy&#x2019;s back, her father always said, but the side was almost as good.

There was a muttering among the lads as Sordaf&#x2014;�big, slow and with scant imagination, but a hell of a choice for stomping on someone who was down&#x2014;�lumbered out onto the sand, doing up the buckles on his mail with fat fingers.<br><br>Edwal&#x2014;�quick and narrow-�shouldered with a tangle of brown curls&#x2014;�didn&#x2019;t move right off. Thorn had always thought he was one of the better ones. &#x201c;Master Hunnan, three of us&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you want a place on the king&#x2019;s raid,&#x201d; said Hunnan, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll do as you&#x2019;re bid.&#x201d;<br><br>They all wanted a place. They wanted one almost as much as Thorn did. Edwal frowned left and right, but no one spoke up. Reluctantly he slipped between the others and picked out a wooden sword.<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t fair.&#x201d; Thorn was used to always wearing a brave face, no matter how long the odds, but her voice then was a desperate bleat. Like a lamb herded helpless to the slaughterman&#x2019;s knife.<br><br>Hunnan dismissed it with a snort. &#x201c;This square is the battlefield, girl, and the battlefield isn&#x2019;t fair. Consider that your last lesson here.&#x201d;<br><br>There were some stray chuckles at that. Probably from some of those she&#x2019;d shamed with beatings one time or another. Brand watched from behind a few loose strands of hair, one hand nursing his bloody mouth. Others kept their eyes to the ground. They all knew it wasn&#x2019;t fair. They didn&#x2019;t care.<br><br>Thorn set her jaw, put her shield hand to the pouch around her neck and squeezed it tight. It had been her against the world for longer than she could remember. If Thorn was one thing, she was a fighter. She&#x2019;d give them a fight they wouldn&#x2019;t soon forget.<br><br>Rauk jerked his head to the others and they began to spread out, aiming to surround her. Might not be the worst thing. If she struck fast enough she could pick one off from the herd, give herself some splinter of a chance against the other two.<br><br>She looked in their eyes, trying to judge what they&#x2019;d do. Edwal reluctant, hanging back. Sordaf watchful, shield up. Rauk letting his sword dangle, showing off to the crowd.<br><br>Just get rid of his smile. Turn that bloody and she&#x2019;d be satisfied.<br><br>His smile buckled when she gave the fighting scream. Rauk caught her first blow on his shield, giving ground, and a second too, splinters flying, then she tricked him with her eyes so he lifted his shield high, went low at the last moment and caught him a scything blow in his hip. He cried out, twisting sideways so the back of his head was to her. She was already lifting her sword again.<br><br>There was a flicker at the corner of her eye and a sick crunch. She hardly felt as if she fell. But suddenly the sand was roughing her up pretty good, then she was staring stupidly at the sky.<br><br>There&#x2019;s your problem with going for one and ignoring the other two.<br><br>Gulls called above, circling.<br><br>The towers of Thorlby cut out black against the bright sky.<br><br>Best get up, her father said. Won&#x2019;t win anything on your back.<br><br>Thorn rolled, lazy, clumsy, pouch slipping from her collar and swinging on its cord, her face one great throb.<br><br>Water surged cold up the beach and around her knees and she saw Sordaf stamp down, heard a crack like a stick breaking.<br><br>She tried to scramble up and Rauk&#x2019;s boot thudded into her ribs and rolled her over, coughing.<br><br>The wave sucked back and sank away, blood tickling at her top lip, dripping pit-�patter on the wet sand.<br><br>&#x201c;Should we stop?&#x201d; she heard Edwal say.<br><br>&#x201c;Did I say stop?&#x201d; came Hunnan&#x2019;s voice, and Thorn closed her fist tight around the grip of her sword, gathering one more effort.<br><br>She saw Rauk step towards her and she caught his leg as he kicked, hugged it to her chest. She jerked up hard, growling in his face, and he tumbled over backward, arms flailing.<br><br>She tottered at Edwal, more falling than charging, Mother Sea and Father Earth and Hunnan&#x2019;s frown and the faces of the watching lads all tipping and reeling. He caught her, more holding her up than trying to put her down. She grabbed at his shoulder, wrist twisted, sword torn from her hand as she stumbled past, floundering onto her knees and up again, her shield flapping at her side on its torn strap as she turned, spitting and cursing, and froze.<br><br>Sordaf stood, sword dangling limp, staring.<br><br>Rauk lay propped on his elbows on the wet sand, staring.<br><br>Brand stood among the other boys, mouth hanging open, all of them staring.<br><br>Edwal opened his mouth but all that came out was a strange squelch like a fart. He dropped his practice blade and lifted a clumsy hand to paw at his neck.<br><br>The hilt of Thorn&#x2019;s sword was there. The wooden blade had broken to leave a long shard when Sordaf stamped on it. The shard was through Edwal&#x2019;s throat, the point glistening red.<br><br>&#x201c;Gods,&#x201d; someone whispered.<br><br>Edwal slumped down on his knees and drooled bloody froth onto the sand.<br><br>Master Hunnan caught him as he pitched onto his side. Brand and some of the others gathered around them, all shouting over each other. Thorn could hardly pick out the words over the thunder of her own heart.<br><br>She stood swaying, face throbbing, hair torn loose and whipping in her eyes with the wind, wondering if this was all a nightmare. Sure it must be. Praying it might be. She squeezed her eyes shut, squeezed them, squeezed them.<br><br>As she had when they led her to her father&#x2019;s body, white and cold beneath the dome of the Godshall.<br><br>But that had been real, and so was this.<br><br>When she snapped her eyes open the lads were still kneeling around Edwal so all she could see was his limp boots fallen outward. Black streaks came curling down the sand, then Mother Sea sent a wave and turned them red, then pink, then they were washed away and gone.<br><br>And for the first time in a long time Thorn felt truly scared.<br><br>Hunnan slowly stood, slowly turned. He always frowned, hardest of all at her. But there was a brightness in his eyes now she had never seen before.<br><br>&#x201c;Thorn Bathu.&#x201d; He pointed at her with one red finger. &#x201c;I name you a murderer.&#x201d;<br><br>In the Shadows<br><br>&#x201c;Do good,&#x201d; Brand&#x2019;s mother said to him the day she died. &#x201c;Stand in the light.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d hardly understood what doing good meant at six years old. He wasn&#x2019;t sure he was much closer at sixteen. Here he was, after all, wasting what should have been his proudest moment, still trying to puzzle out the good thing to do.<br><br>It was a high honor to stand guard on the Black Chair. To be accepted as a warrior of Gettland in the sight of gods and men. He&#x2019;d struggled for it, hadn&#x2019;t he? Bled for it? Earned his place? As long as Brand could remember, it had been his dream to stand armed among his brothers on the hallowed stones of the Godshall.<br><br>But he didn&#x2019;t feel like he was standing in the light.<br><br>&#x201c;I worry about this raid on the Islanders,&#x201d; Father Yarvi was saying, bringing the argument in a circle, as ministers always seemed to. &#x201c;The High King has forbidden swords to be drawn. He will take it very ill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The High King forbids everything,&#x201d; said Queen Laithlin, one hand on her child-�swollen belly, &#x201c;and takes everything ill.&#x201d;<br><br>Beside her, King Uthil shifted forward in the Black Chair. &#x201c;Meanwhile he orders the Islanders and the Vanstermen and any other curs he can bend to his bidding to draw their swords against us.&#x201d;<br><br>A surge of anger passed through the great men and women of Gettland gathered before the dais. A week before Brand&#x2019;s voice would&#x2019;ve been loudest among them.<br><br>But all he could think of now was Edwal with the wooden sword through his neck, drooling red as he made that honking pig sound. The last he&#x2019;d ever make. And Thorn, swaying on the sand with her hair stuck across her blood-�smeared face, jaw hanging open as Hunnan named her a murderer.<br><br>&#x201c;Two of my ships taken!&#x201d; A merchant&#x2019;s jewelled key bounced on her chest as she shook her fist toward the dais. &#x201c;And not just cargo lost but men dead!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the Vanstermen have crossed the border again!&#x201d; came a deep shout from the men&#x2019;s side of the hall, &#x201c;and burned steadings and taken good folk of Gettland as slaves!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grom-�gil-�Gorm was seen there!&#x201d; someone shouted, and the mere mention of the name filled the dome of the Godshall with muttered curses. &#x201c;The Breaker of Swords himself!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Islanders must pay in blood,&#x201d; growled an old one-�eyed warrior, &#x201c;then the Vanstermen, and the Breaker of Swords too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course they must!&#x201d; called Yarvi to the grumbling crowd, his shrivelled crab-�claw of a left hand held up for calm, &#x201c;but when and how is the question. The wise wait for their moment, and we are by no means ready for war with the High King.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One is always ready for war.&#x201d; Uthil gently twisted the pommel of his sword so the naked blade flashed in the gloom. &#x201c;Or never.&#x201d;<br><br>Edwal had always been ready. A man who stood for the man beside him, just as a warrior of Gettland was supposed to. Surely he hadn&#x2019;t deserved to die for that?</p><h2>Collectors Guide To Post Cards</h2><p>Over 2,000 post cards are featured in this interesting and informative look at this popular paper collectible.

Specific guidelines and explorations merge the values, purposes, and methods of both fields. Facilitators learn how to apply this work in a wide variety of situations. The powerful images illustrate case material and the extraordinary effects of this profound group process. Ultimately, this book is about courage, creative expression, compassion, cooperation, and raising the collective consciousness to heal the planet. No small order. Yet the dynamic, humanistic process of person-centered expressive arts fosters in individuals and groups the ability to achieve this goal as they become authentic, self-actualized, and empowered. The forceful element of creative expression brings individuals personally and collectively into their strength, honing the ability to envision a brighter future and act across political or antagonistic boundaries to a more peaceful, all-inclusive way of being</p><p>Natalie Rogers, Ph.D., REAT, is the groundbreaking originator of the Creative Connection ®, a transformational person-centered expressive arts therapeutic process that is embraced by psychotherapists, teachers, healers, leaders and diverse groups around the world. Author of The Creative Connection: Expressive Arts as Healing (1993) and Emerging Woman: A Decade of Midlife Transitions (1980), Natalie s mission for personal and planetary healing has led her to cross-cultural work in Europe, Russia, Latin America, Japan, South Korea and Israel, where she has lectured and facilitated groups seeking greater harmony and individual growth. Her work integrates the values, methods and core conditions of her father, Carl Rogers, who developed the person-centered therapeutic approach, and her passion for expressive arts and creativity. She helped found the International Expressive Art Therapy Association (IEATA) and was awarded its first Lifetime Achievement Award. She also founded and was senior faculty at the Person-Centered Expressive Therapy Institute, Santa Rosa, California,(1984-2004). Presently she is a Distinguished Consulting Faculty at Saybrook University, San Francisco. She and her co-faculty members have assisted graduates of these certificate programs in creating trainings in Argentina, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.The Creative Connection for Groups is the life-synthesizing work of Natalie Rogers, illuminating the way of comprehensive artistic expression and healing through the support, challenges, energy, and wisdom of groups. The work is amplified and affirmed by the contributions of a world-wide community of colleagues who join Natalie in celebrating a shared vision of creative collaboration in all spheres of life.

The two walked home together from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study every day; they shared ideas about physics, philosophy, politics, and the lost world of German science in which they had grown up. By 1949, G�del had produced a remarkable proof: <i>In any universe described by the Theory of Relativity, time cannot exist</i> . Einstein endorsed this result-reluctantly, since it decisively overthrew the classical world-view to which he was committed. But he could find no way to refute it, and in the half-century since then, neither has anyone else. Even more remarkable than this stunning discovery, however, was what happened afterward: nothing. Cosmologists and philosophers alike have proceeded with their work as if G�del's proof never existed -one of the greatest scandals of modern intellectual history. <i>A World Without Time</i> is a sweeping, ambitious book, and yet poignant and intimate. It tells the story of two magnificent minds put on the shelf by the scientific fashions of their day, and attempts to rescue from undeserved obscurity the brilliant work they did together.</p><p><b>Palle Yourgrau</b> is a Professor of Philosophy at Brandeis University. His 1999 monograph <i>G�del Meets Einstein</i> , the only book-length work on G�del's cosmological ideas, has caused a resurgence of interest among philosophers in G�del's ideas about time and relativity. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.What if time is only an illusion, if it doesn't actually exist? Yourgrau, a Brandeis professor of philosophy, explains that Einstein's general theory of relativity may allow for this possibility, first realized by the great logician Kurt G�del. G�del is best known for his incompleteness theorem, one of the most important theorems in mathematical logic since Euclid. In a typically brief paper written for a Festschrift to honor his friend and Princeton neighbor Einstein, G�del theorized the existence of what have come to be called G�del universes: rotating universes in which time travel is possible. But if one can travel through time, how can time as we know it exist in these other universes, since the past is always present? And if time doesn't exist in other universes, then it may not exist in ours either. Yourgrau (<i>The Disappearance of Time</i>) writes that G�del's paper was almost universally ignored, and he claims that since the logician's death, philosophers have gone out of their way to try to denigrate his work in fields other than logic. This book will appeal to fans of Douglas Hofstadter's <i>G�del, Escher, Bach </i>and to Einstein junkies, and makes a fascinating companion to Rebecca Goldstein's <i>Incompleteness </i>(Forecasts, Dec. 20), but all readers who enjoy a good thought experiment or having basic preconceptions about their world challenged will enjoy this. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nagel is a complete outsider, a sort of modern Christ treated in a spirit of near parody. He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the insulted and injured and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of Prussic acid. The novel creates a powerful sense of Nagel&#39;s stream of thought, as he increasingly withdraws into the torture chamber of his own subconscious psyche.</p><p>The main character, like the title says, is a mysterious guy. Nagel arrives in a Norwegian town with plenty of money and goodwill, and though kind of an eccentric, seems to start to fit in with the local crowd. But it's almost as if Nagel only just landed on Earth, and while he wishes to live correctly, has no idea how to do it.

Rouse yourself from the collective coma you mistake for &#x2018;real life&#x2019;. See through the illusion of separateness and recognize that we are all essentially one. Although we appear to be isolated individuals, in reality there is one awareness dreaming itself to be everyone and everything. This is our shared essential nature. The simple secret to enjoying this dream we call &#x2018;life&#x2019; is to wake up to oneness. Because, knowing you are one with all, you will find yourself in love with all. You will fall in love with living. This is the message of the original Christians, who symbolised this awakened state with the enigmatic figure of &#x2018;the laughing Jesus&#x2019;.<br><br> Have you ever seen a picture of Jesus laughing? Probably not, because we have inherited a distorted form of Christianity created by the Roman Church in the fourth century, which focuses exclusively on Jesus the &#x2018;man of sorrows&#x2019;. The image that has dominated our culture is that of a man being tortured to death on a cross. But the original Christians didn&#x2019;t see Jesus as an historical man who &#x2018;suffered for our sins&#x2019;. They viewed Jesus as the mythical hero of a symbolic teaching story, which represents the spiritual journey leading to the experience of awakening they called &#x2018;gnosis&#x2019;, or &#x2018;knowing&#x2019;.<br><br> The original Christians were inspired men and women who saw how good life could be if we would just wake up and live in love. They imagined a new world that would no longer be divided into slaves or citizens, men or women, Gentiles or Jews. But inadvertently, this band of non-conformists gave birth to a totalitarian regime that would rule Europe with an iron fist for over a thousand years. The result was not Heaven on Earth, but the Holy Roman Empire. The dream became a nightmare.<br><br> The Roman Church did all it could to suppress the teachings of gnosis and the image of the laughing Jesus. It succeeded so well that it now seems strange to even suggest that Christianity was originally about awakening. But in the middle of the twentieth century some of the texts of the original Christians were found in a cave near Nag Hammadi in Egypt. In these texts the message of awakening is proclaimed loud and clear.<br><br> Those who have realised gnosis have set themselves free by waking up from the dream in which they lived and have become themselves again.<br><br> How can you bear to be asleep, when it&#x2019;s your responsibility to be awake?<br> <br>You are asleep and dreaming. Wake up.<br><br> Listen to my teachings, which are good and practical, and end the sleep which weighs so heavily upon you.<br><br> People are caught up in many vain illusions and empty fictions, which torment them like sleepers prey to nightmares. When they wake up they see that all those dreams were nothing. This is the way it is with those who have cast ignorance aside, as if waking from sleep. They no longer see the world as real, but like a dream at night. They value gnosis as if it were the dawn. Whilst they exist in a state of ignorance it is as if everyone is asleep. Experiencing gnosis is like waking up.<br><br> Such teachings of awakening are not exclusively Christian. Throughout history men and women of all faiths have woken up to oneness and love. We use the broad term &#x2018;Gnostic&#x2019; meaning &#x2018;knower&#x2019; to refer to all such individuals because, although they express their insights in the various languages of their diverse cultures, they all talk about the experience of awakening or gnosis.<br><br> These charismatic individuals often inspired the formation of small communities dedicated to waking up. But, ironically, the more successful such groups become the more they turn into their opposite. What begins as a loose alliance of free-thinking non-conformists degenerates over time into an organised, authoritarian religion, and people end up completely misunderstanding the original message. We refer to this degenerate form of Gnosticism as &#x2018;Literalism&#x2019;.<br><br> Gnosticism is sometimes called &#x2018;the perennial philosophy&#x2019; because it has been found in all cultures and all times. It is not that Gnostics all say exactly the same thing. They don&#x2019;t. It is rather that their teachings are like fingers pointing from different perspectives to the same experience of gnosis. Unfortunately, most people focus on the finger and miss the point. This is Literalism. Literalist religions are clubs for people who want to worship the finger of their founder as the One True Finger, but who have no understanding of the experience of awakening towards which it points.<br><br> This book is a damning indictment of Literalist religion and a passionate affirmation of Gnostic spirituality. Let&#x2019;s start by clearly discriminating Gnosticism from Literalism:<br><br>Gnostics teach that the important thing is to wake up and experience gnosis for ourselves.<br>Literalists teach that the important thing is to blindly believe in religious dogmas.<br>Gnostics interpret their teachings as signposts pointing to the experience of awakening.<br>Literalists see their teachings as literally the truth itself.<br>Gnostics use symbolic parables to communicate the way to wake up.<br>Literalists mistake Gnostic myths for literal accounts of miraculous historical events and end up lost in irrational superstition.<br>Gnostics know that all books contain the words of men.<br>Literalists believe that sacred scripture is the Word of God.<br>Gnostics understand that the way the wisdom of awakening is expressed must constantly evolve to address the ever-changing human condition.<br>Literalists want a fixed canon of scripture which has absolute authority for all time.<br>Gnostics want us to think for ourselves, so that we become more conscious and wake up. <br>Literalists want us to believe what they believe, so that we will join their cult.<br>Gnostics understand that life itself is a process of awakening.<br>Literalists believe their particular religion is the only way to the truth and condemn everyone else as lost in diabolical error.<br>Gnosticism is about waking up from the illusion of separateness to oneness and love.<br>Literalism keeps us asleep in an &#x2018;us versus them&#x2019; world of division and conflict, inhabited by the &#x2018;chosen&#x2019; and the &#x2018;damned&#x2019;.<br>Gnosticism unites us. <br>Literalism divides us.<br> Throughout history Gnostics have ceaselessly exposed Literalist religion as a pernicious source of ignorance, division and suffering. This Gnostic message has never been more relevant than today. The three great religions of the West&#x2014;Judaism, Christianity and Islam&#x2014;are on a collision course that threatens the security of the whole world. Taking religious myths literally is the root cause of the problems in the Middle East which led to 9/11 and a host of other atrocities since. But there is nothing new about religious violence. The present conflict is just the continuation of a long and gruesome history of killing and dying for God.<br><br> The burning of Christians by Pagans as flaming torches to light their games. The brutal Christian revenge on the Pagans. The relentless persecution of the Jews by Christians. The violent expansion of the Muslim empire and the bloody conquest of India. The barbaric crusades by Christians against the Muslims. The horrors of the Inquisition. The genocide of indigenous people in the New World. The mass burnings of witches. All were motivated by the desire to please God. All were justified with reference to sacred texts that not only condoned such behaviour but demanded it. These evils have not occurred because the perpetrators were bad people, but because they were in the grip of very bad ideas.<br><br> <b>The Baby and the Bathwater</b><br><br> The time has come to say enough of this madness and consign Literalist religion to the garbage can of history. But we must be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Religion isn&#x2019;t all bad. It has answered the profound human yearning to understand the mysteries of life and death. It has inspired people of all cultures to create sublime works of art, glorious cathedrals and temples, transcendental music and songs. It has this power because at its heart is Gnostic spirituality. In this book we want to rescue the teachings of gnosis from under the accumulated debris of religious dogma, so that we can jettison outdated religious Literalism but retain and revivify the perennial wisdom of awakening.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s stop blindly believing in old books and listen instead to those heretical voices that have been drowned out by the cacophony of Literalist war cries. Just imagine for a moment that what Gnostics have been telling us throughout the ages is true. We appear to be separate, but essentially we are all one. The awareness that is conscious in you is the same awareness that is conscious in everyone. And if you recognise this, you will find yourself in love with all.<br><br> Imagine what would happen if we actually began to wake up and live by the Gnostic teachings of oneness and love. If we started to truly love our neighbours, and even our enemies, because we recognise that they are actually expressions of our own deeper self. If we saw through to the reality that there are no Jews, Christians or Muslims. There is no &#x2018;us versus them&#x2019;. There is only us. This is the Gnostic vision that has inspired us to write this book.<br><br> In Part 1, &#x2018;The Bathwater,&#x2019; we undertake a religious detox to flush the poison of Literalism out of our system. We take a good hard look at the supposedly &#x2018;sacred&#x2019; scriptures of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and demonstrate that t...</p><h2>The Worst Journey in the World: Antarctic 1910-13</h2><p>The author recounts his experiences on Scott&#39;s last Antarctic expedition and describes the hardships of polar exploration</p><p>As Apsley Cherry-Garrard states in his introduction to the harrowing story of the Scott expedition to the South Pole, "Polar Exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised." Cherry-Garrard's <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i> is a gripping account of an expedition gone disastrously wrong. The youngest member of Scott's team, the author was later part of the rescue party that eventually found the frozen bodies of Scott and three men who had accompanied Scott on the final push to the Pole. These deaths would haunt Cherry-Garrard for the rest of his life as he questioned the decisions he had made and the actions he had taken in the days leading up to the Polar Party's demise. <p>Prior to this sad denouement, Cherry-Garrard's account is filled with details of scientific discovery and anecdotes of human resilience in a harsh environment. Each participant in the Scott expedition is brought fully to life. Cherry-Garrard's recollections are supported by diary excerpts and accounts from other teammates. Despite the sad fate of Scott, the reader will grudgingly agree with the closing words of <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i>: "Exploration is the physical expression of the Intellectual Passion. And I tell you, if you have the desire for knowledge and the power to give it physical expression, go out and explore.... If you march your Winter Journeys you will have your reward, so long as all you want is a penguin's egg."</p>"Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time that has ever been devised" wrote Apsley Cherry-Garrard in a deceptively jaunty introduction to this classic story of bravery and fortitude first published in 1922. The story he relates is of Scott's last expedition to the Antarctic. From its departure from England in 1910 to its arrival in New Zealand in 1913, it is one of the most famous and tragic in the annals of exploration. Driven by an obsession for scientific knowledge, these brave polar explorers embarked on a journey into the unknown, testing their endurance by pushing themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they surveyed the striking and mammoth land that lay far to the south.<br>Cherry-Garrard was himself a member of the expedition that had two goals: to discover as much as was scientifically possible about the terrain and habitat of Antarctica, and to be the first to reach the South Pole. The party was plagued by bad luck, weather conditions of unanticipated ferocity, and the physical deterioration of the party on the last part of the journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole a month before them, Scott's party then had to negotiate the last, heroic part of their journey, a doomed attempt which has entered modern mythology.<br>The Worst Journey in the World is the inside story of this most famous of journeys and is truly one of the best and most moving books of travel ever written. Join Scott's expedition as he and his team venture deep into the frozen unknown.

As Dr. Cloud unpacks these universal, eternal principles, he reveals that true happiness is not about circumstances, physical health, financial success, or even about the people in our lives. In other words, it&#x2019;s not about the factors that are frequently beyond our control. Rather, happiness is found in choosing to become the kind of people God created us to be.<br><br>With chapter titles like &#x201c;Happy People Connect,&#x201d; &#x201c;Happy People Are Envy-Free,&#x201d; &#x201c;Happy People Have a Calling,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Happy People Forgive,&#x201d; Cloud shows just how happiness is achieved as he sets readers on a pathway of spiritual transformation that connects them with the God of the universe. With these new tools, readers will discover that their relationships, their careers, and their inner selves are infused with the joy they&#x2019;ve been seeking.</p><p>Dr. Henry Cloud has written or cowritten more than twenty books, including the bestselling Boundaries series. His books have sold more than ten million copies. Dr. Cloud has appeared on numerous radio and TV broadcasts, including ABC News, PBS, and FOX News, and has been featured or reviewed in the<i> Los Angeles Times</i>,<i> The New York Times</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, and others.

In fact, the book&#x2019;s premise, as you may recall, was that the entire universe is governed by that one principle. Byrne&#x2019;s claim was that the universe responds to your thoughts and that you attract happiness to yourself by the power of what you think. If you think positive thoughts, the universe responds to your thoughts by bringing positive outcomes to you, and if you think negative thoughts, your outcomes will be negative. People by the millions responded to the idea that this one law was the secret to happiness and all they desired in life. And, as a psychologist and performance coach, I can certainly tell you that people who think positively have much better outcomes than negative thinkers. For sure.<br><br>While Byrne&#x2019;s book deals with concepts that interface with spirituality, it also brings up a lot of questions about how the Law of Attraction interfaces with more traditional views of spirituality, God, and the like. The first book in this series, <i>The Secret Things of God,</i> examined where those principles agreed with traditional faith, where they disagreed, and also what clinical experience and research say about the same issues. It was a really meaningful project for me, personally, and many readers responded as well.<br><br>So that brought us to the question of &#x201c;what next&#x201d;? What other topics of personal well-being also interface with spirituality and spiritual wisdom? When my editor asked me that question and what I would like to write about, the answer was immediate. &#x201c;I want to write about happiness,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Happiness? Why happiness?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>I explained that the field of psychology in the last several years has been actively exploring what is referred to as &#x201c;positive psychology.&#x201d; A number of years ago, Martin Seligman (then president of the American Psychological Association) and others championed the message that while psychology had made great strides in its studies on the &#x201c;negative&#x201d; side of life&#x2014;such as depression, trauma, anxiety&#x2014;it had spent relatively little time studying the &#x201c;up&#x201d; side of life. Topics such as happiness, well-being, strengths, etc., had not gained the same amount of attention, especially from scientific research. Researchers began to soundly answer that call.<br><br>The result has been an enormous amount of empirical studies that have shed substantial light on questions such as: &#x201c;Where does happiness come from?&#x201d; &#x201c;Can people increase their happiness?&#x201d; &#x201c;Is it under our control?&#x201d; And the good news is that research has actually produced a lot of answers. We now know, not just from experience, but also from scientific data, a lot about the sources of happiness and the lifestyles and practices that actually produce overall well-being.<br><br>I would have enjoyed writing about this happiness research and how it applies to life, but that has been done already by others. I did not feel the need to add to the list of good books out there. But I was drawn to writing a book on happiness for The Secret Things of God series because of what had happened to me as I was investigating the field of positive psychology.<br><br>As the profession was churning out more and more information on the positive side of life, learning was a lot of fun, and the data clearly resonated with my own experience, both professionally and personally. I had seen firsthand the truths that the research was revealing, so I loved what I was studying. But for me, it was much more than that.<br><br>It was a spiritual journey as well. <i>As I was reading the research findings, I felt like I was reading the Bible.</i> It was as if someone took the data and laid the Bible right on top of it and the fit was perfect. Basically, over and over, the robust findings of the research were the same as the ancient spiritual wisdom found in the Scriptures. I saw Moses, Solomon, Jesus, and Paul as I read study after study, which were proving that happiness and fulfillment is not found in our circumstances, our bank accounts, our material possessions, or achievements. Instead, what the research revealed was that happiness comes largely from how we live our lives and into which activities we decide to invest our hearts, minds, souls, and strength.<br><br>So that is why I wanted to write this book on happiness in a series of books about how faith integrates with life. Just as the Bible has a lot to say about &#x201c;positive thinking&#x201d; and the Law of Attraction, it has even more to say about happiness and fulfillment. In fact, one of my favorite words that we hear over and over in the Bible is the Hebrew word <i>shalom,</i> which among other things implies peace, happiness, well-being, wholeness, completeness, and welfare&#x2014;most of what we mean when we say we want to be &#x201c;happy.&#x201d; In short, we can be assured that the Creator has always been interested in our happiness and well-being.<br><br>But further, he is also interested that we know how to find <i>shalom:</i><i>by investing our lives in the ways that he designed life to be lived.</i> And that was where I was so impacted by the research. It was literally proving through science that the path to happiness is the path that God has been telling us to walk for a long time. Happiness comes as a by-product of the &#x201c;life well lived.&#x201d; And that is what brought me to the title, <i>The Law of Happiness:</i> I wanted to show the two things that the research has shown me.<br><br>Number one, that happiness can be found and there are principles and practices that reveal that. And number two, those principles and practices, the &#x201c;law of happiness,&#x201d; are the ones that God has given all along in his &#x201c;law,&#x201d; the Scriptures. From the Torah, which means &#x201c;instruction,&#x201d; through the rest of the Bible, he has shown us the &#x201c;law of happiness.&#x201d; And now science has verified what the Bible has said all along. For me, that was a really cool thing to behold, and I hope it is for you as well&#x2014;that you further experience how faith and science interact.<br><br>So join me as we take a look at what science reveals and what spiritual instruction has shown us about where happiness comes from. <i>Shalom.</i><br><br>� 2011 Henry Cloud|<b><b>1</b><br>THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS<br></b><br><br><b>MY CO-HOST ON</b> our radio show, <i>New Life Live!,</i> lit up with enthusiasm when I pulled my minicomputer out before the show one day. &#x201c;I am so excited,&#x201d; he exclaimed. &#x201c;I just got one of those and can&#x2019;t wait to use it. People tell me that what they can do is incredible!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean &#x2018;can&#x2019;t wait to use it?&#x2019;&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;If you have it, why aren&#x2019;t you using it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something is wrong with it, and I have an appointment to take it in. I brought it home, and it wouldn&#x2019;t turn on,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;so, I have to get it fixed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s strange,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It is unusual for them to ship one that won&#x2019;t even boot up. What did you try?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I hit the buttons there on the bottom, and clicked it a bunch, and kept trying over and over, but it never would do anything,&#x201d; he explained.<br><br>&#x201c;That is so weird,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But why were you hitting those buttons? Those are the mouse clickers. Did you hit this one up on the corner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is that? I didn&#x2019;t see that one,&#x201d; he said as he peered over my screen.<br><br>&#x201c;Watch this,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>As I hit the power button, the familiar blue screen came up, the sound effects chimed in, and my friend stared in amazement. &#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d; he queried.<br><br>&#x201c;I turned it on,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;It works better when you do that.&#x201d;<br><br>So, what does my colleague&#x2019;s computer have to do with happiness? Turns out, a lot.<br><br>Here is what the scientific research is finding about happiness: <i>we are wired to experience happiness, but we keep hitting the wrong buttons in our efforts to turn our happiness on.</i><br><br>As I mentioned earlier, for more than a hundred years, psychology has often been interested in happiness only in its absence. The interest has focused more on our pain, hurt, depression, and anxiety: &#x201c;Why do we suffer, and what can the doctor do about it?&#x201d; And, as research validates, psychology has done quite a good job. We know how to treat depression, anxiety, addictions, and other issues well. The results are promising. And if you are experiencing any of those pains, there is help for you. I strongly encourage you to seek out competent psychological and psychiatric help. In our discussion about happiness, I do not want to seem to ignore the very real pains in life.<br><br>But, what about the upside of life? Is there more to life than not being depressed or unhappy? What scientific research has found is that, just like computers are designed to work when properly turned on, humans are wired in such a way that when properly &#x201c;turned on,&#x201d; they get happier. Their brains begin to secrete chemicals that make them feel better, their bodies get healthier, they make more money, their relationships improve, their marriages are more fulfilling, they live longer, and their overall sense of well-being and happiness gets better. And what is amazing is that we now have a lot of documentation to show exactly where the power buttons are and how to turn them on.<br><br><b>THE LAW OF HAPPINESS</b><br><br><i>H</i><b><i>umans are wired in such a way that<br>when properly &#x201c;turned on,&#x201d; they get happier.</i></b><br><br>PUSHING THE WRONG BUTTONS<br><br>Unfortunately, we often don&#x2019;t know where the power buttons are, so we keep pushing the wrong ones, hoping that we are just one click away from happiness. People watch talk shows on TV and think the experts being interviewed have the answers. We think that if we try this or that particular diet or do what this magazine article says or buy the secret that this infomercial is selling us, we will get to the land of happiness. We are just one click away from having it all come together . . . or are we?<br><br>We fall prey to thinking things like:<br><ul><li><br>If I could just make a little more money, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I could just find that special someone and get married, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I could get that promotion, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I could finally own a home, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I could move and live in a different city, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I could get that new model (of whatever), then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I just could get my _______ degree, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I could lose twenty pounds, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I were beautiful, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If we could move to that neighborhood, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I were rich, then I would be happy.<br></li><li><br>If I were famous, then I would be happy.<br></li></ul><br>Research and spiritual wisdom both reveal that while many of these items certainly have value, none can bring much <i>sustainable</i> happiness. And that is what I mean by &#x201c;pushing the wrong button.&#x201d; While most of what we need to feel better is readily available to us, we often don&#x2019;t know where to find the correct buttons, and we continue to look to the wrong buttons and hope they will work.<br><br>PATHS TO UNSUSTAINABLE HAPPINESS<br><br>There are at least three reasons that the new house, the new job, the new relationship, the bigger bank account, or any of the other things on the list will not make us happy.<br><br><i>Reason Number One: Our External Circumstances<br>Do Not Have the Inherent Power to<br>Bring Us Happiness</i><br><br>If you look at the list above, you&#x2019;ll see that all of these desires&#x2014;as well as many others&#x2014;are circumstantial. They are &#x201c;states&#x201d; within which we find ourselves, like rich or poor, degreed or not, renting or owning, skinny or fat. These states can change at any given time in our lives. But most of all, they are &#x201c;outside us.&#x201d; What has the research into happiness shown us about our circumstances? The answer is surprising, especially since we live in a culture that is obsessed with the list above and others like it. Here is the finding: <i>Circumstances account for only about 10 percent of our happiness.</i>1<br><br>It is true that when you get a promotion or that new car you have wanted or most anything else on the list, you will feel a sense of happiness for a little while. But what science has found is that you might think you are going to be a lot happier than you actually are after you get what you want. Circumstantial things or events have the power to make us happier&#x2014;but only a little bit&#x2014;and as we shall see in a moment, only for a little while. As my father used to tell me, &#x201c;Son, money can&#x2019;t buy happiness. But it can buy you a big red Cadillac to go look for it in.&#x201d;<br><br>In other words, money is not a bad thing, nor are nice houses. But don&#x2019;t bank on it as the answer to happiness. I do remember when my dad got his first Cadillac&#x2014;and it was a happy day for him&#x2014;but as I have come to understand from my professional life and experience, the happiness that <i>he brought</i> to that day from living a certain kind of life was much more powerful than that car ever could be. All the car did was give him a comfortable ride to his various life activities, which were already producing his real and lasting happiness and continued to do so for most of his ninety-four years.<br><br>The fact that our circumstances have limited power to make us happy has been documented in the research; but if you think about it for a minute, you already know this from your observations while standing at the check-out counter at any grocery store. Look at the magazine headlines and you will see rich, beautiful, accomplished, famous, slim, and successful people, but with all sorts of unhappiness, from relational turmoil to drug abuse and overdose, and even suicide. If circumstantial things could bring us lasting happiness, we would not be seeing those sad headlines. And the flip side is this: if circumstantial things and events are the sources of happiness, why are there so many happy people who <i>don&#x2019;t</i> have many of those things going for them? In fact, studies have shown that the happiness levels between rich people and average-income people is not that different. The findings say that once a certain safety and sustenance level has been reached, more money is not going to bring much more happiness.2<br><br><i>Reason Number Two: Circumstantial Happiness<br>Does Not Last</i><br><br>Psychological research has shown something else about &#x201c;getting&#x201d; or &#x201c;achieving&#x201d; some external, circumstantial state as the path to happiness: <i>It does not last.</i> It has a short shelf life. So, not only do our circumstances and achievements account for only a small percentage of our happiness, but even what they are able to contribute evaporates pretty quickly. Why?<br><br>It seems that there is some sort of &#x201c;set point&#x201d; to our level of happiness that we carry around, almost like a thermostat.3 Let&#x2019;s say your set point from factors other than circumstances is at 70. Then you get that new house, and you jump up to 80 or, for a day, to what feels like 100! This happens, for instance, when people first fall in love with the persons of their dreams. They may even exceed 100 in that initial state. (That explains a lot of crazy behavior.) But whether it is the house, the raise, or the relationship, what research has shown us is that we come back down to the place we were before. We return to our set point. This is called the &#x201c;hedonic treadmill.&#x201d; This is why, as common sense will tell you, you can look back at things you thought you would &#x201c;just die for,&#x201d; and now they are stored in the garage and you don&#x2019;t care much for them anymore.

Beautiful patterns are accompanied by touching diary entries from early settlers.</p><p></p><h2>Highsmith: A Romance of the 1950&#39;s</h2><p>Patricia Highsmith, author of such classics as <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i> and <i>Strangers on a Train</i>, was a writer who defied simple categorization. Gore Vidal called her: "One of the greatest modernist writers." The <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> rightly commented: "Patricia Highsmith is often called a mystery or crime writer, which is a bit like calling Picasso a draftsman."<br><br>To young novelist Marijane Meaker, however, Highsmith was more than a role model. Shortly after the two met in a New York City lesbian bar, they became lovers and embarked on a two year romance amidst the bohemian set of Greenwich Village and the literary crowd of Fire Island. There, the pair navigated the underground lesbian scene, lunched with literary stars like Janet Flanner, shared intimacies, and gossiped with abandon. Written with wit and brassy candor, <i>Highsmith: A Romance of 1950s</i> is a revealing look at the controversial icon of popular American fiction.</p><p><i>Highsmith: A Romance of the 1950s</i> begins like a brainy, romantic novel complete with exotic settings, fast-paced dialogue, and a who&#x2019;s who of the 1950s New York literati. All this should not be surprising given that Marijane Meaker&#x2019;s tale of her two-year relationship with famed mystery novelist Patricia Highsmith comes from a pen that has crafted more than 40 works of fiction and non-fiction. <p> Meaker&#x2019;s touch is light and clear. She backlights her memoir with glimpses of the New York scene of the era: the Mafia-controlled lesbian bars, the rise of Fire Island, the rage for Freudian psychoanalysis. She doesn't attempt a detailed literary biography, nor is the book a complete psychological portrait of Highsmith. But Meaker, a self-proclaimed lover of pseudonymous disguises, does peer beneath Highsmith&#x2019;s public mask to reveal her constant despair over a disapproving mother, her fascination/obsession with Germany, and her discomfort around intellectuals. This, and Meaker&#x2019;s persistent jealousy and constant fear that her beloved Pat would leave her to write in Europe slowly edges the narrative into darker territory. Inevitably, the lovers part, as each author kills off the other, albeit in fictional form, with their first post-relationship murder mysteries. </p><p> Meaker closes the book by describing her difficult 1992 reunion with Highsmith. Meaker depicts her ex-lover as a hard-drinking, grizzled, chain-smoking, bigoted woman recently returned from Europe and recovering from a bout with lung cancer. Far from the bright beginnings of young love in the 1950s, this segment provides a depth absent from the earlier, more novelistic chapters and provides a glimpse of what a further, more complete biography might have to offer. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Marijane Meaker is the author of more than forty books, many of which were written under the pennames Vin Packer and M.E.

Mostly illiterate, they were self-made mystics and gifted storytellers, humble peddlers and rugged loggers who dwelt in harmony with their Muslim and Christian neighbors in the mountains of northern Iraq. To these descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel, Yona Sabar was born. <br><br>Caught unawares by growing ethnic tensions in the Middle East after World War II, the Jews of Zakho were airlifted to the new state of Israel in the 1950s with the mass exodus of 120,000 Jews from Iraq&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;s largest and least-known diasporas.

The pattern of this commentary is simple. First, each Psalm is presented in its Old Testament framework of origin, literal meaning, and purpose, with a minimum of space given to its classification and the interesting points that fill other commentaries. Second, the commentary interprets this literal reality (including the difficult parts of the Psalms) in the light of Christ and the New Testament. The entire Old Testament prepares for Him and His Kingdom. Therefore to seek the fulfillment sense is not a minimum law (applicable to a few verses), but a maximum one (Cardinal Newman). The Psalms are forward-looking; they speak about Christ. The search for this final sense of the Psalms has occupied the Church in every generation; it must engage our best efforts in comparing one spiritual world with another, with the help of God, who is Author of both.

Deprived at a single blow of their Emperor, of the Orb that is the focus of the Empire's power, of their capital city with its Imperial bureaucracy, and of a great many of their late fellow citizens, the surviving Dragaerans have been limping through a long Interregnum, bereft even of the simple magic and sorcery they were accustomed to use in everyday life.</p><p>Now the descendants and successors of the great adventurers Khaavren, Pel, Aerich, and Tazendra are growing up in this seemingly diminished world, convinced, like their elders, that the age of adventures is over and nothing interesting will ever happen to them. They are, of course, wrong . . . </p><p>For even deprived of magic, Dragaerans fight, plot, and conspire as they breathe, and so do their still-powerful gods.

Our goal is to present a credible, helpful, Christian perspective on the images your daughter is exposed to every day.<br><br>If, on the other hand, you believe she is already committed to sexual purity, or you fear that a frank discussion on the topic may be inappropriate for her, we encourage you to review <i>Every Young Woman&#x2019;s Battle </i>before passing it on to your daughter. We have made every effort to address sensitive issues with tact and respect, emphasizing God&#x2019;s desire that young women live with sexual integrity.

Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. -- John 8:31-32<br><br>Truth or dare. You&#x2019;ve probably played this game with girlfriends at a slumber party or perhaps been warned by your parents not to play it at all. It&#x2019;s a game where you agree to do anything another player dares you to do, regardless of how embarrassing or disgusting it may be, or else to tell the absolute truth in response to a particular question, regardless of how private or humiliating your answer may be.<br><br>As a young girl, I never opted out of playing such games. It never even occurred to me I had a choice. My friends dared me to do some ridiculous things&#x2013;eat a ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise sandwich; drink a Dr. Pepper as fast as possible and then burp as loudly as I could in front of my friend&#x2019;s older brother; and passionately kiss my stuffed monkey while my friend took a Polaroid picture. But I usually took the dare because I didn&#x2019;t want to answer questions such as these: Who do you think is the cutest boy in school? How many boys have you kissed? How far have you ever gone with a boy? Eating something gross or making an idiot out of myself was easy compared to telling the truth about certain things.<br><br>Sometimes the truth hurts, and it&#x2019;s much easier if we can keep it hidden. As a matter of fact, sometimes the secrets we harbor are so painful that we don&#x2019;t want to face them ourselves. We assume that these secrets will go away if we don&#x2019;t think or talk about them with anyone. But the opposite is true. Shameful secrets fester like a splinter in a finger, and it&#x2019;s much better to name the secret and to let someone help us remove it from our lives so the wound will heal. <br><br>You will read many stories in this book from young women (ages twelve to twenty) who have courageously done just that. They&#x2019;ve dared to tell the truth about their battle to guard their minds, hearts, and bodies from sexual sin. We hope that you will learn some lessons the easy way and avoid making mistakes of your own, or that you will recognize the truth about any struggles you are currently facing in your battle for sexual purity and understand how you can overcome them.<br><b><br><br>IGNORANCE IS NOT A VIRTUE<br></b><br>You may find some of the stories in this book eyeopening or surprising. Please know that we are not trying to shock, disgust, or defile* you in any way. We want you to be wise to the ways of the world so you can guard yourself against them. Ignorance is not a spiritual gift, nor is it a virtue. You can be wise <i>and </i>innocent at the same time, and we intend to prepare you to make responsible decisions if and when temptations come across your path. Also, don&#x2019;t assume that the temptations we&#x2019;ll be discussing won&#x2019;t come to call in your life. The apostle Paul wrote:<br><br>So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don&#x2019;t fall!...<br>Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled.... Do not<br>conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. But<br>just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written:<br>&#x201c;Be holy, because I am holy.&#x201d;...

One of them was a good enough friend to me to confess to her parents what we had done. My parents were extremely upset, and I don&#x2019;t blame them. They even helped me by having someone change the television settings so that nothing pornographic comes in now, and that channel is blank.<br><br>I was fine for a while and tried very hard to forget what I saw, which worked for the most part. But recently I have developed a habit of masturbating&#x2020; to these images and cannot stop. I know this is wrong, and I feel<br>dirty and guilty. I have confessed my sins to God, but that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be enough. I don&#x2019;t want anyone to find out, because I know that they would be disgusted and disappointed in me.<br><br>We&#x2019;re sure that if Molly had known how addicting pornography can be, she would have avoided it altogether. If either pornography or habitual masturbation have become problems in your life, this book will help you break free from these habits that hinder your sexual integrity and spiritual peace.<br><b><br><br>LAUREN&#x2019;S PRIVATE WAR<br></b><br>Lauren attended a sexuality conference when she was in junior high and made a pledge to remain sexually abstinent until marriage.

It&#x2019;s not only possible, but we believe you&#x2019;ll agree that it&#x2019;s much better to wait to enjoy sex according to God&#x2019;s perfect plan&#x2013;in marriage someday&#x2013;than to engage in sexual activities as if they&#x2019;re just another recreational hobby.

This volume follows the show&#x2019;s structure. Each venue has a dedicated section which includes a preface by Filipovic, photographic documentation of each exhibition and a contribution by Vo, Bove and Sehgal reflecting upon their positions as curators of Gonzalez-Torres&#x2019; work.<br><br>Danh Vo includes photographs of diagrammatic brass wall plaques as presented within his installation at WIELS; Carol Bove offers an essay describing her personal experiences with the work of Gonzalez-Torres and the curatorial scope of her installation; and Tino Sehgal recorded a conversation with Andrea Rosen&#x2015;Gonzalez-Torres&#x2019; lifelong art dealer&#x2015;which captures part of their rich dialogue around the artist&#x2019;s work.<br><br>A comparative illustrated checklist documents each of the 85 works by Gonzalez-Torres featured in all their iterations.

It contains a unique gathering of autographs, biographies, and rare photographs to give a personal view of Adolf Hitler and the individuals that influenced him, and those he captivated with his far reaching ideas. This historical document has been superbly researched and written and belongs in the library of every person that loves and cherishes the autograph hobby, both collector and dealer alike.</p><p>Just an note for quick clarification here: there are 2 volumes in this same-named set: Vol. 1 being published in 1984, and Vol. 2 a decade later in 1996. Autograph-collecting buffs of WWII personalities will really enjoy these books that provide almost 1,000 pages of facsimile autograph examples and photographs of some 900 Hitler apparachnicks (and a few of his opponents), along with their biographies. Vol. 1 consists of autograph examples of primarially NAZI-party leaders, their political toddies and enforcing henchmen, and the Gauleiter political lords of the captured countries. Vol. 2 consists of autograph examples of primarially German WWII military personalities, along with some foreign military and political officials; has two chapters devoted to German spies and cultural leaders, and a short chapter discussing the forgeries of Hitler documents and etchings. These books are printed on choice glossy paper, which provides sharp and clear photographs and excellent facsimile reproductions of autographed documents. The author provides nice pithy comments regarding the personality shortcomings for most of these individuals.

Now they are available as four retreats on inner peace to people in every stage of spiritual growth. Years of research and testing come together in Michael Hansen, S.J.'s, recreation of the way that St. Ignatius first gave the Exercises as he travelled with four companions, begging in bare feet and dressed in sackcloth.</p></p><p>Michael Hansen, S.J., is a retreat leader, speaker, and spiritual director on the retreat team at the Campion Centre of Ignatian Spirituality in Kew, Victoria, Australia. He has worked in schools and parishes and produced radio and television programs. He is the author of four other books."A beautiful book and an important one as well. Michael Hansen, S.J., an experienced Jesuit retreat director and a talented writer, recovers an often-overlooked way of praying with St. Ignatius Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. But this is much more than a guide for a fulfilling personal retreat; it is also a compendium of inspiring meditations, useful insights, and practical advice for anyone who seeks a closer relationship with God. In these pages is a wealth of knowledge that I will surely be using in the future--both in counseling others and in my own prayer life." --<b>James Martin, S.J., </b>, Author of <i>The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything</i><p><br>"<i>The First Spiritual Exercises</i>, written and piloted by Fr. Michael Hansen, S.J. is an important breakthrough in our understanding of the Spiritual Exercises and for potentially extending an experience of the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius to many, many more people of all ages than other more familiar forms of the Exercises. Great care is displayed in the inclusion of texts for and about women as well as grounding every retreat in key Gospel texts that introduce the person making these Exercises to a deeply Gospel spirituality as well as Ignatian approaches to prayer and transformation into discipleship." --<b>Janet K. Ruffing, R.S.M. </b>, Professor in the Practice of Spirituality and Ministerial Leadership, Yale Divinity School</p><p><br>"Michael Hansen, S.J,. helps readers meet the living God who wants a personal relationship with them. From years of experience he knows the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola very well and leads the reader in a creative and easy-to-follow way through them without jargon and with a deft hand. I am very happy to recommend this book and I sense that St. Ignatius rejoices that his great work has been made so accessible to modern readers." --<b>William A. Barry, S.J. </b>, Author of <i>A Friendship Like No Other</i></p><p> <br>"If you are looking for a clear, simple, and practical approach to developing your prayer life in the Ignatian tradition, <i>The First Spiritual Exercises</i> is well worth procuring. One of Ignatius's most radical and contentious insights was that the Creator engages directly with the heart of the creature. What I particularly like about the exercises in <i>The First Spiritual Exercises</i> is that they invite, stimulate, and give us freedom, if we dare, to dispose ourselves to experience such an encounter." --<b>Brendan Kelly, S.J. </b>, Master of Jesuit Novices, Australia</p><p><br>"Jesuit Michael Hansen's <i>The First Spiritual Exercises</i> captures in a helpful way Ignatius's process of spiritual renewal and makes it an accessible and useful tool for deepening an intimate connection with God today. I highly recommend it." --<b>Wilkie Au</b>, Author and Professor of Theological Studies, Loyola Marymount University</p><p><br>"Michael Hansen has graced us with a fresh look at Saint Ignatius's <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>. Rooted deep in both Ignatius's understanding of the spiritual life and also the realities of Christian discipleship in the contemporary world, Hansen offers us a thorough immersion in the Ignatian school of divine love. I highly recommend Hansen's text for use among religious and lay people, in retreat centers, in schools, in parishes, and in conversations among friends.

He was a Harvard-trained confidant of presidents; she was a poor Midwestern farmer&#x2019;s daughter raised to be suspicious of the seasons. Yet the bond between them would shape history.</p><p>The newly married couple reached Los Angeles in 1887 when it was still a frontier, and within a few years Frederick, the only heir to an immense Boston fortune, became one of the wealthiest men in the state. After his sudden death in 1905, May spent the next thirty years fighting off some of the most powerful men in the country&#x2015;as well as fissures within her own family&#x2015;to preserve Malibu as her private kingdom. Her struggle, one of the longest over land in California history, would culminate in a landmark Supreme Court decision and lead to the creation of the Pacific Coast Highway.</p><p><em>The King and Queen of Malibu</em> traces the path of one family as the country around them swept off the last vestiges of the Civil War and moved into what we would recognize as the modern age. The story of Malibu ranges from the halls of Harvard to the Old West in New Mexico to the beginnings of San Francisco&#x2019;s counter culture amid the Gilded Age, and culminates in the glamour of early Hollywood&#x2015;all during the brief sliver of history in which the advent of railroads and the automobile traversed a beckoning American frontier and anything seemed possible.</p> 8 pages of illustrations; map</p><p>David K.

The campfires burned on either side of the river, stretching away into the night. Quietly flowing, the Deisa caught the moonlight and the orange of the nearer fires and cast them back in wavery, sinuous ripples. And all the lines of light led to his eyes, to where he was sitting on the riverbank, hands about his knees, thinking about dying and the life he&#x2019;d lived.</p><p>There was a glory to the night, Saevar thought, breathing deeply of the mild summer air, smelling water and water flowers and grass, watching the reflection of blue moonlight and silver on the river, hearing the Deisa&#x2019;s murmurous flow and the distant singing from around the fires. There was singing on the other side of the river too, he noted, listening to the enemy soldiers north of them. It was curiously hard to impute any absolute sense of evil to those harmonizing voices, or to hate them quite as blindly as being a soldier seemed to require. He wasn&#x2019;t really a soldier, though, and he had never been good at hating.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t actually see any figures moving in the grass across the river, but he could see the fires and it wasn&#x2019;t hard to judge how many more of them lay north of the Deisa than there were here behind him, where his people waited for the dawn.</p><p>Almost certainly their last. He had no illusions; none of them did. Not since the battle at this same river five days ago. All they had was courage, and a leader whose defiant gallantry was almost matched by the two young sons who were here with him.</p><p>They were beautiful boys, both of them. Saevar regretted that he had never had the chance to sculpt either of them. The Prince he had done of course, many times. The Prince called him a friend. It could not be said, Saevar thought, that he had lived a useless or an empty life. He&#x2019;d had his art, the joy of it and the spur, and had lived to see it praised by the great ones of his province, indeed of the whole peninsula.</p><p>And he&#x2019;d known love, as well. He thought of his wife and then of his own two children. The daughter whose eyes had taught him part of the meaning of life on the day she&#x2019;d been born fifteen years ago. And his son, too young by a year to have been allowed to come north to war. Saevar remembered the look on the boy&#x2019;s face when they had parted. He supposed that much the same expression had been in his own eyes. He&#x2019;d embraced both children, and then he&#x2019;d held his wife for a long time, in silence; all the words had been spoken many times through all the years. Then he&#x2019;d turned, quickly, so they would not see his tears, and mounted his horse, unwontedly awkward with a sword on his hip, and had ridden away with his Prince to war against those who had come upon them from over the sea.</p><p>He heard a light tread, behind him and to his left, from where the campfires were burning and voices were threading in song to the tune a syrenya played. He turned to the sound.</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; he called softly. &#x201c;Unless you want to trip over a sculptor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Saevar?&#x201d; an amused voice murmured. A voice he knew well.</p><p>&#x201c;It is, my lord Prince,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Can you remember a night so beautiful?&#x201d;</p><p>Valentin walked over&#x2014;there was more than enough light by which to see&#x2014;and sank neatly down on the grass beside him. &#x201c;Not readily,&#x201d; he agreed. &#x201c;Can you see? Vidomni&#x2019;s waxing matches Ilarion&#x2019;s wane. The two moons together would make one whole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A strange whole that would be,&#x201d; Saevar said.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis a strange night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it? Is the night changed by what we do down here? We mortal men in our folly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The way we see it is,&#x201d; Valentin said softly, his quick mind engaged by the question. &#x201c;The beauty we find is shaped, at least in part, by what we know the morning will bring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What will it bring, my lord?&#x201d; Saevar asked, before he could stop himself. Half hoping, he realized, as a child hopes, that his dark-haired Prince of grace and pride would have an answer yet to what lay waiting across the river. An answer to all those Ygrathen voices and all the Ygrathen fires burning north of them. An answer, most of all, to the terrible King of Ygrath and his sorcery, and the hatred that <i>he</i> at least would have no trouble summoning tomorrow.</p><p>Valentin was silent, looking out at the river. Overhead Saevar saw a star fall, angling across the sky west of them to plunge, most likely, into the wideness of the sea. He was regretting the question; this was no time to be putting a burden of false certitude upon the Prince.</p><p>Just as he was about to apologize, Valentin spoke, his voice measured and low, so as not to carry beyond their small circle of dark.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been walking among the fires, and Corsin and Loredan have been doing the same, offering comfort and hope and such laughter as we can bring to ease men into sleep. There is not much else we can do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They are good boys, both of them,&#x201d; Saevar offered. &#x201c;I was thinking that I&#x2019;ve never sculpted either of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for that,&#x201d; Valentin said. &#x201c;If anything lasts for any length of time after us it will be art such as yours. Our books and music, Orsaria&#x2019;s green and white tower in Avalle.&#x201d; He paused, and returned to his original thought. &#x201c;They <i>are</i> brave boys. They are also sixteen and nineteen, and if I could have I would have left them behind with their brother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and your son.&#x201d;</p><p>It was one of the reasons Saevar loved him: that Valentin would remember his own boy, and think of him with the youngest prince, even now, at such a time as this.</p><p>To the east and a little behind them, away from the fires, a trialla suddenly began to sing and both men fell silent, listening to the silver of that sound. Saevar&#x2019;s heart was suddenly full, he was afraid that he might shame himself with tears, that they would be mistaken for fear.</p><p>Valentin said, &#x201c;But I haven&#x2019;t answered your question, old friend. Truth seems easier here in the dark, away from the fires and all the need I have been seeing there. Saevar, I am so sorry, but the truth is that almost all of the morning&#x2019;s blood will be ours, and I am afraid it will be all of ours. Forgive me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is nothing to forgive,&#x201d; Saevar said quickly, and as firmly as he could. &#x201c;This is not a war of your making, nor one you could avoid or undo. And besides, I may not be a soldier but I hope I am not a fool. It was an idle question: I can see the answer for myself, my lord. In the fires across the river.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the sorcery,&#x201d; Valentin added quietly. &#x201c;More that, than the fires. We could beat back greater numbers, even weary and wounded as we are from last week&#x2019;s battle. But Brandin&#x2019;s magic is with them now. The lion has come himself, not the cub, and because the cub is dead there must be blood for the morning sun. Should I have surrendered last week? To the boy?&#x201d;</p><p>Saevar turned to look at the Prince in the blended moonlight, disbelieving. He was speechless for a moment, then found his voice. &#x201c;I would have gone home from that surrender,&#x201d; he said, with resolution, &#x201c;and walked into the Palace by the Sea, and smashed every sculpture I ever made of you.&#x201d;</p><p>A second later he heard an odd sound. It took him a moment to realize that Valentin was laughing, because it wasn&#x2019;t laughter like any Saevar had ever heard.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my friend,&#x201d; the Prince said, at length, &#x201c;I think I knew you would say that. Oh, our pride. Our terrible pride. Will they remember that most about us, do you think, after we are gone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Saevar said. &#x201c;But they will remember. The one thing we know with certainty is that they will remember us. Here in the peninsula, and in Ygrath, and Quileia, even west over the sea, in Barbadior and its Empire. We will leave a name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And we leave our children,&#x201d; Valentin said. &#x201c;The younger ones. Sons and daughters who will remember us. Babes in arms our wives and grandfathers will teach when they grow up to know the story of the River Deisa, what happened here, and, even more&#x2014;what we were in this province before the fall. Brandin of Ygrath can destroy us tomorrow, he can overrun our home, but he cannot take away our name, or the memory of what we have been.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He cannot,&#x201d; Saevar echoed, feeling an odd, unexpected lift to his heart. &#x201c;I am sure that you are right. We are not the last free generation. There will be ripples of tomorrow that run down all the years. Our children&#x2019;s children will remember us, and will not lie tamely under the yoke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And if any of them seem inclined to,&#x201d; Valentin added in a different tone, &#x201c;there will be the children or grandchildren of a certain sculptor who will smash their heads for them, of stone or otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>Saevar smiled in the darkness. He wanted to laugh, but it was not in him just then. &#x201c;I hope so, my lord, if the goddesses and the god allow. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No thanks, Saevar. Not between us and not this night. The Triad guard and shelter you tomorrow, and after, and guard and shelter all that you have loved.&#x201d;</p><p>Saevar swallowed. &#x201c;You know you are a part of that, my lord. A part of what I have loved.&#x201d;</p><p>Valentin did not reply. Only, after a moment, he leaned forward and kissed Saevar upon the brow. Then he held up a hand and the sculptor, his eyes blurring, raised his own hand and touched his Prince&#x2019;s palm to palm in farewell. Valentin rose and was gone, a shadow in moonlight, back towards the fires of his army.</p><p>The singing seemed to have stopped, on both sides of the river. It was very late. Saevar knew he should be making his own way back and settling down for a few snatched hours of sleep. It was hard to leave though, to rise and surrender the perfect beauty of this last night. The river, the moons, the arch of stars, the fireflies and all the fires.</p><p>In the end he decided to stay there by the water. He sat alone in the summer darkness on the banks of the River Deisa, with his strong hands loosely clasped about his knees. He watched the two moons set and all the fires slowly die and he thought of his wife and children and the life&#x2019;s work of his hands that would live after him, and the trialla sang for him all night long.</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>A BLADE<br>IN THE SOUL</p><p>CHAPTER<br>� 1 �</p><p>IN THE AUTUMN SEASON OF THE WINE, WORD WENT FORTH from among the cypresses and olives and the laden vines of his country estate that Sandre, Duke of Astibar, once ruler of that city and its province, had drawn the last bitter breath of his exile and age and died.</p><p>No servants of the Triad were by his side to speak their rituals at his end. Not the white-robed priests of Eanna, nor those of dark Morian of Portals, nor the priestesses of Adaon, the god.</p><p>There was no particular surprise in Astibar town when these tidings came with the word of the Duke&#x2019;s passing. Exiled Sandre&#x2019;s rage at the Triad and its clergy through the last eighteen years of his life was far from being a secret. And impiety had never been a thing from which Sandre d&#x2019;Astibar, even in the days of his power, had shied away.</p><p>The city was overflowing with people from the outlying distrada and far beyond on the eve of the Festival of Vines. In the crowded taverns and khav rooms truths and lies about the Duke were traded back and forth like wool and spice by folk who had never seen his face and who would have once paled with justifiable terror at a summons to the Ducal court in Astibar.</p><p>All his days Duke Sandre had occasioned talk and speculation through the whole of the peninsula men called the Palm&#x2014;and there was nothing to alter that fact at the time of his dying, for all that Alberico of Barbadior had come with an army from that Empire overseas and exiled Sandre into the distrada eighteen years before. When power is gone the memory of power lingers.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, and certainly because he tended to be cautious and circumspect in all his ways, Alberico, who held four of the nine provinces in an iron grip and was vying with Brandin of Ygrath for the ninth, acted with a precise regard for protocol.</p><p>By noon of the day the Duke died, a messenger from Alberico was seen to have ridden out by the eastern gate of the city. A messenger bearing the blue-silver banner of mourning and carrying, no one doubted, carefully chosen words of condolence to Sandre&#x2019;s children and grandchildren now gathered at their broad estate seven miles beyond the walls.</p><p>In The Paelion, the khav room where the wittier sort were gathering that season, it was cynically observed that the Tyrant would have been more likely to send a company of his own Barbadian mercenaries&#x2014;not just a single message-bearer&#x2014;were the living Sandreni not such a feckless lot. Before the appreciative, eye-to-who-might-be-listening, ripple of amusement at that had quite died away, one itinerant musician&#x2014;there were scores of them in Astibar that week&#x2014;had offered to wager all he might earn in the three days to come, that from the Island of Chiara would arrive condolences in verse before the Festival was over.</p><p>&#x201c;Too rich an opportunity,&#x201d; the rash newcomer explained, cradling a steaming mug of khav laced with one of the dozen or so liqueurs that lined the shelves behind the bar of The Paelion. &#x201c;Brandin will be incapable of letting slip a chance like this to remind Alberico&#x2014;and the rest of us&#x2014;that though the two of them have divided our peninsula the share of art and learning is quite tilted west towards Chiara. Mark my words&#x2014;and wager who will&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll have a knottily rhymed verse from stout Doarde or some silly acrostic thing of Camena&#x2019;s to puzzle out, with Sandre spelled six ways and backwards, before the music stops in Astibar three days from now.&#x201d;</p><p>There was laughter, though again it was guarded, even on the eve of the Festival, when a long tradition that Alberico of Barbadior had circumspectly indulged allowed more license than elsewhere in the year. A few men with heads for figures did some rapid calculations of sailing-time and the chances of the autumn seas north of Senzio province and down through the Archipelago, and the musician found his wager quickly covered and recorded on the slate on the wall of The Paelion that existed for just such a purpose in a city prone to gambling.</p><p>But shortly after that all wagers and mocking chatter were forgotten. Someone in a steep cap with a curled feather flung open the doors of the khav room, shouted for attention, and when he had it reported that the Tyrant&#x2019;s messenger had just been seen returning through the same eastern gate from which he had so lately sallied forth. That the messenger was riding at an appreciably greater speed than hitherto, and that, not three miles to his rear was the funerary procession of Duke Sandre d&#x2019;Astibar being brought by his last request to lie a night and a day in state in the city he once had ruled.</p></p><h2>Fodor&#39;s Essential Spain 2020 (Full-color Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Whether you want to experience the Alhambra, explore Madrid&#x2019;s incredible museums, eat delicious tapas, drink Spanish wine, or enjoy Flamenco performances, the local Fodor&#x2019;s travel experts in Spain are here to help! <i>Fodor&#x2019;s Essential Spain 2020</i> is part of the award-winning Fodor&#x2019;s Essential series recognized by Booklist as the &#x201c;Best Travel Guide in 2019.&#x201d; This guidebook is packed with maps, carefully curated recommendations, and everything else you need to simplify your trip-planning process and make the most of your time. </b><p>This <b>new edition</b> has been <b>FULLY-REDESIGNED</b> with an easy-to-read layout, fresh information, and beautiful color photos. </p><p><b>GET INSPIRED </b></p><ul><b>� AN ILLUSTRATED ULTIMATE EXPERIENCES GUIDE</b> to the top things to see and do </ul><ul><b>� PHOTO-FILLED &#x201c;BEST OF&#x201d; FEATURES </b>on Best Beaches in Spain, Best Museums in Spain, Best Festivals in Spain, and more</ul><ul><b>� COLOR PHOTOS </b>throughout to spark your wanderlust! </ul><ul><b>� UP-TO-DATE and HONEST RECOMMENDATIONS</b> covering the most recommended sights, restaurants, hotels, nightlife, shopping, museums, performing arts, activities, side-trips, and more </ul><p><b>GET PLANNING </b></p><ul><b>� MULTIPLE ITINERARARIES</b> to effectively organize your days and maximize your time</ul><ul><b>� SPECIAL FEATURES</b> on &#x201c;The Alhambra&#x2019;s Architecture,&#x201d; &#x201c;El Camino de Santiago,&#x201d; &#x201c;El Prado: Madrid&#x2019;s Brush with Greatness,&#x201d; &#x201c;Flamenco: the heartbeat of Spain,&#x201d; and Eating and Drinking Well in all regions of Spain </ul><ul><b>� COVERS: </b>Madrid, Barcelona, the Alhambra, El Prado, La Sagrada Familia, Catalonia, Andalusia, Valencia, Bilbao, La Rioja wine country, the Basque Country, San Sebastian, Seville, Granada, Santiago de Compostela, Cordoba, Toledo, the Pyrenees, Ibiza, the Canaries, and more</ul><ul><b>� NEW COVERAGE </b>of the Canary Islands, including charming white villages, luxurious island resorts, unspoiled beaches, and unique landscapes</ul><p><b>GET GOING </b></p><ul><b>� MORE THAN 50 DETAILED MAPS AND A FREE PULLOUT MAP</b> to navigate confidently </ul><ul><b>� TRIP-PLANNING TOOLS AND PRACTICAL TIPS</b> on when to go, getting around, beating the crowds, and saving time and money </ul><ul><b>� HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL INSIGHTS</b> providing rich context on the local people, politics, art, architecture, cuisine, dance, and more </ul><ul><b>� LOCAL WRITERS</b> to help you find the under-the-radar gems</ul><ul><b>� SPANISH LANGUAGE PRIMER </b>with useful words and essential phrases </ul><p>Planning on visiting France or Portugal?

With a harmonious integration of both timeless spiritual wisdom from the Catholic Church's tradition of prayer and direction, and the insight of the psychological sciences, Fathers Thomas Acklin and Boniface Hicks offer a comprehensive guide for all who provide or seek spiritual direction. </p> <p><i>Spiritual Direction: A Guide for Sharing the Father's Love</i> fortifies priests, religious, and lay faithful who embrace the ministry of spiritual direction and accompany the wounded, assist men and women in hearing the voice of God, and model the love and mercy of the Father for the many who are seeking Him but do not know Him or have false images of Him. This book also shows how various aspects of the spiritual life can emerge from and be fostered by a one-on-one relationship with a spiritual director. </p> <p>Together with concrete guidelines and numerous examples from personal experience, this book refers extensively to Sacred Scripture as the foundation for spiritual direction. Furthermore, since the practice of spiritual direction goes back to the first centuries of the Church, the authors turn for guidance to the Doctors of the Church, the writings of the saints, and the papal magisterium in developing and supporting their insights. </p> <p><i>Spiritual Direction</i> will call spiritual directors to deeper holiness even as they assist others in growing closer to the Father through His loving gaze of mercy.</p></p><p><p>Fr.

Yoga is how you are being in the pose."&nbsp;&#x2014;Rolf Gates</i><br><br>I have chosen to begin with a chapter on effort. The remainder of the book will be about things that we do and choices that we make, and I feel that it&#x2019;s important, before embarking on that journey, to explain that how we perform an action is as important as the action itself.<br><br>Sometimes, even when we apply ourselves to all the right things for all the right reasons and get good results, we continue to experience the same inner suffering that drove us to seek help in the first place. It feels as though we will never be free of a nagging inner tension, a belief that as much as we want things to be okay, they never will be. This can be a permanent state of affairs but it does not have to be. With the right support we can discover something simple and easy to remember that will alter how we approach the process of change. We come to see that how we are being is more important than what we are doing.<br><br>Doing a yoga pose while attached to a specific result is not the practice of yoga, it is the practice of attachment. Attachment focuses on the results and pulls our attention away from the process and opportunities for positive outcomes that present themselves as a moment unfolds. Starting a career, ending a marriage, or raising a family in a state of attachment to the outcome, likewise, is the practice of attachment and will yield the results of attachment. We can&#x2019;t free ourselves from a way of being without consciously letting go of that way of being. We must let go of what the Buddhists call our &#x201c;contracted states&#x201d; if we wish to experience what exists beyond them.<br><br>When I first started out as a yoga teacher, I tried to teach people to be in a pose without the effort of control or attachment. These two forms of effort felt to me as if they were at the heart of most contracted states. In my own practice, when I could identify the energies of attachment and control within me and let them go, I could access inner stillness, deepen my awareness of the present moment, and arrive at an overall steadier place on my mat and on my cushion. Control and attachment were obscuring my connection to the present moment, and when I was able to let them go things improved rapidly. I wanted my students to experience this. But it is my belief that telling someone not to do something is not as helpful as telling someone what to do. So I maintained the same intention but kept refining my language. Eventually, I began to teach students to hold a pose with the intention of effortlessness.<br><br>I had been teaching yoga as the embodiment of intention for some time. I would, for example, teach students to come into the intentions of awareness and ease in their bodies, and to rest in the felt experience of those intentions. How are these intentions being expressed? Is the energy of control there? Is the energy of attachment there? I began to ask, &#x201c;Can you allow the expression of those intentions to be effortless?&#x201d; Spiritual practice can be understood as cultivating the habit of meeting low-�energy patterns, like ill will or craving, with high-�energy intentions, like kindness and generosity. This process finds its true potential when we discover the ability to hold a high-�energy intention effortlessly.<br><br>Yoga finds its relevance when it can impact the way we are moving through life. My personal intention for my relationships is that I embody wisdom and compassion as I relate to my students, joy and equanimity as I drive my children to school, steadiness and ease as I sit in meditation, and loving-�kindness and appreciation as I have lunch with my wife.<br><br>In my experience, I can seek to embody love while also being attached to the results of my actions and still trying to control others. I can create inner turmoil with the very practices that are designed to relieve it. To express an intention effortlessly empties the intention of anything extra. I can be love without attachment, awareness without control. This chapter explores the felt experience of effortlessness.<br><br>DAY 1<br>Getting Set<br>The air that travels across the Pacific Ocean before it reaches land has a special aliveness and sweetness to it. Breathing it feels like drinking the purest water. Waking in the early morning, I find a stillness that can be felt the way Pacific Ocean air can be breathed. Most days this stillness is the first thing I bring my conscious attention to. In the quiet darkness, I listen to it the way you listen to a breeze moving through fall leaves, breathing it in with my whole body. Taking my seat for meditation is a deliberate process. Steady in my connection to the earth (sits bones even), with a strong center (core), rooted in spirit (aware and engaged through the back of my torso), I offer my heart (shoulder integration) and align my will and my wisdom to the divine (ears over shoulders). The physical effort of coming into alignment is then transferred to the inner body, which brightens as the outer body softens. The balancing of my inner body and my outer body is arrived at effortlessly. The stillness of the seat I&#x2019;ve taken vanishes into the stillness of the morning.<br><br>DAY 2<br>Knowing That I Am Sitting When I Am Sitting<br>Once I have taken my seat, I begin the process of letting go. The momentum that got me to my seat is no longer required in the way that walking is no longer required once you have arrived at your destination. Taking my seat is a shift from thinking to feeling. The rest of my meditation practice is a continuation of that process. The first thing I feel into is my body and the fact that I can be consciously aware of it without commentary. I spend time in the mystery of knowing that I am sitting when I am sitting. My body, and my awareness of it, brings me into direct contact with the ordinary nature of the miraculous. I am living, embodied awareness, within and expressing an eternal moment the way a wave is within and expresses the ocean. At the heart of this dynamic experience is an effortless stillness that feels like home to me.<br><br>DAY 3<br>Just Passing Through<br>Connecting to stillness is like connecting to silence. We come to see that stillness and silence form the backdrop of our lives and that everything else is just passing through. Sounds come and go, sensations come and go, thoughts, emotions, all of them traveling through stillness and silence like fish moving through an eternal ocean or weather traveling across an eternal sky. As I begin my meditation, my body carries with it the experience of stillness and my mind becomes silent. I become the sky that holds the weather. Resting in the felt experience of my body, I am able to give my full attention to the weather of my life, to care for what is coming and going with wisdom and compassion, to love what is just passing through.<br><br>DAY 4<br>Life&#x2019;s Heartbeat<br>Sound travels through silence in patterns we call rhythm. Sensation travels through awareness in rhythms. Movements arise and pass rhythmically. A funny joke, a well-�taught yoga class, the sound of anger, the pitch of joy, the rocking of a baby to sleep&#x2014;�all of it is rhythm. It is said that everything in the physical universe is information vibrating at different rhythms; the study of life amounts to the study of rhythm. Time spent in silence and stillness reveals this to be true. There is the eternal moment and there are the rhythms it holds like the sky holding weather. The first rhythm I was taught to feel into, or experience, was the rhythm of the breath. As I did so I discovered life&#x2019;s heartbeat. Within the rhythm of my breathing is the rhythm of all the breaths and all the heartbeats. Within the rhythm of my breathing lies the secret that I am every being and every being is me.<br><br>DAY 5<br>The First Breath<br>A friend of mine told me about a teacher who said to him, &#x201c;I know the last thing you will do.&#x201d; My friend was taken aback, but nonetheless he asked the teacher, &#x201c;Okay, what will be the last thing I do?&#x201d; The teacher replied, &#x201c;You will exhale.&#x201d; I have heard my friend tell this story a few times, and it always gets a laugh and gets people thinking. Our thoughts turn to our last breath and then, I believe, most of us reflect on our first breath. What was it like, to awaken into this world on an inhale? After a period of meditation on the body I begin to include the rhythm of the breath. Having rested in the felt experience of sitting, I begin to rest in the felt experience of sitting and breathing. As my attention moves into the breath there is always a moment of awakening to the act of breathing as I take my first full inhale.<br><br>DAY 6<br>Sitting and Breathing<br>Yoga practice is intensely practical and wastes nothing. To learn about life you study movement and stillness. Walking becomes a practice, standing becomes a practice, lying down and doing nothing becomes a practice, sitting and breathing becomes a practice. In the peace of the early morning, as I let go of the need to do anything or be anywhere else, I find myself sitting and breathing in the midst of a world waking up. Birdsong moving in and out of silence, cool morning air drifting on the subtlest of currents, the smell of earth and leaves wet from ocean fog, eternal silence, stillness, and space. I have a friend whose love of ocean diving began when she realized the tiny crab she was observing at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea shared a world that stretched around the entire planet. Sitting and breathing, we begin to understand the vastness of the moment in which we exist.<br><br>DAY 7<br>Resting<br>I held my son, Dylan, for the first forty-�five minutes or so of his life. I watched as his eyes opened and he saw light for the first time. He looked at me and he smiled. The nurses said it could not be but it was. Once we brought Dylan home I held him in many different ways. I had a sling he could live in like a cave, a snuggly he rested in on my chest, one-�armed and two-�armed carries, a backpack; however I carried him we were always so close we could feel each other&#x2019;s heartbeats. To this day when Dylan is upset he lies on my chest so that his heart is on my heart and he just lets go. Sitting and breathing is like that for me: resting my heart in life&#x2019;s heart and learning to let go.<br><br>DAY 8<br>Becoming Available<br>It is said that the mind screams and the heart whispers. Over time we have lost touch with the wisdom of the heart in our efforts to manage the demands of our screaming minds. Instead of learning to listen we have learned to numb and to filter. The sensations that get through our filters and our numbness become supersized. Fear becomes violence, desire becomes gluttony, service to one&#x2019;s community becomes workaholism. More is never enough. Arising out of this state of imbalance is its opposite, a study of the subtle whose end point is the heart&#x2019;s whisper. This study is called yoga, and we make a beginning when we become available to what is happening right now. While sitting we become available to the felt experience of sitting. While breathing we become available to the felt experience of breathing. Sitting and breathing as the world wakes up, we become available to the world waking up.<br><br>DAY 9<br>Plans<br>I tend to make a plan and then get attached to it. Anything that is not according to plan is not welcome. My time as a military officer did not lessen this propensity, nor have my years spent running the show in various capacities as a &#x201c;senior&#x201d; teacher. I always have a plan and so I know how things are supposed to go&#x2014;�according to plan, obviously. Despite a lifetime of negative consequences brought about by living this way, I did not reconsider it until my first child was born. At that point the frustrations to my plans reached an unprecedented level. Nothing about a day with a baby goes according to any plan you have ever made. My plans were a straight line and life was revealing itself to be a nonlinear series of moments. My family did not live within my lines; my wife and daughter lived in the open space of the moment. What I needed was a way to become available to a life that was a living moment rather than a plan. It was then that I discovered sitting and breathing effortlessly.<br><br>DAY 10<br>Learning to Swim<br>On my first meditation retreat I was surprised by how little instruction I received. There was a talk each night and some lecturing each morning, but for about twenty-�three out of every twenty-�four hours I was on my own. There was plenty of structure and accountability&#x2014;�we did walking and sitting meditation in forty-�five-�minute periods all day&#x2014;�but there just was not a lot of handholding and I felt some handholding was in order. Left to my own devices I began to create a routine for myself within the routine of the retreat: when I would have tea, when I would walk outside, when I would make time for some yoga poses. I found a place to take in the sunset over a snow-�covered field. I learned to create a good day out of a number of good moments, my plans to give the organizers some &#x201c;feedback&#x201d; at the end of the retreat forgotten as I sat astonished by the aching beauty of a forest quietly allowing the passage of a winter&#x2019;s day. By trusting me my teachers were teaching me to trust myself and to trust life.<br><br>DAY 11<br>Return Is the Movement<br>It was not necessary for my meditation teachers to fill my days with intellectual content. In fact, that would have been the opposite of what I needed. What they were providing me with was the opportunity to see and feel something that had always been there but that I had lost touch with in the growing busyness and confusion of the echo chamber of my mind. The forest did not stage a special one-�time-�only winter day because I had paid to be on that retreat; the world had been effortlessly manifesting its stillness and rhythms every second of my existence. There was just a little work I had to do to be present for it. The gift of yoga is not something new; it is something being returned to us.</p><h2>Yotsuba&amp;!, Vol. 14 (Yotsuba&amp;!, 14)</h2><p>Everyone's favorite green-haired five-year-old is back!

During one of my trips to British Columbia, I visited Shangri-La Hotel Vancouver for a traditional afternoon tea. I ordered a pot of chamomile tea and the house apricot and current scones. When the tea server clad in a cheongsam arrived to my table, I was intimidated. In hindsight, perhaps a high pour of the teapot (like "A Lot Like Love" film Oliver does for show in the restaurant scene with Chinese flue music playing in the background) would have impressed her. She left the Blue Willow China tea pot at my table.

(But at least I didn't pick up my saucer with the cup.)&nbsp;&nbsp;She replaced the full tea cup with wilted tea leaves floating like dead goldfish. I felt my face warm up and turn red from embarrassment because I failed tea etiquette. I asked for a doggy bag for the pricey scones, and walked out like a pup with its tail between its legs.

Her research, teaching, and writing focus heavily on gender, sexual orientation, intersectionality, and social justice. Her first children&#x2019;s book won the 2015 ALA Stonewall Award. She lives in Rio Linda, California.&nbsp;Gr 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;A thorough if somewhat disjointed examination of the events before, during, and in the aftermath of the Stonewall Riots gives young readers an overview of the LGBTQ+ activism of the 1950s and 1960s. Pitman traces meeting places, social clubs, and the rise of organizations and activist groups as well as the many police raids of gay establishments, focusing on the June 28, 1969, raid on the mob-owned Stonewall Inn. Due to a lack of documented accounts, use of pseudonyms, and conflicting reports, controversies remain over the actuality of events at Stonewall. Post-Stonewall, readers learn about the increase in radical groups and visibility that challenged negative attitudes and discrimination. Pitman occasionally expands the narrative focus to examine what was happening in various places around the country and to consider other issues and movements of the time, including weaknesses and missteps in the movement for LGBTQ+ rights. The unique approach of using various objects (matchbooks, leaflets, buttons, arrest records, photographs, and more, with many reproductions too small or low resolution to read) to guide, inform, and reconstruct the story of the riots prevents a smooth narrative flow and makes the text feel repetitive as it moves back and forth in time. Back matter includes a time line, notes, bibliography, and an index. VERDICT An important look at a major moment in American history. Readers will come to understand why the iconic Stonewall Inn is now on the National Register of Historic Places, a National Historic Landmark, and a National Monument.&#x2014;Amanda MacGregor, Parkview Elementary School, Rosemount, MN</p><h2>Panzram A Journal of Murder</h2><p>A detailed memoir and self-analysis by a mass murderer. Panzram was born in 1891 on a Minnesota farm and died in 1930 on the gallows at the U.S.Penitentiary, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Imprisoned for most of his life from the age of twelve and brutally punished, Panzram&#39;s keen insight into the arbitrary cruelty of his fellow human being is graphically illustrated with a litany of prison abuses, as well as the details of his own sordid, tragic life. Panzram arrives as a gripping warning from America&#39;s past to new prison-industrial complex era. The authors add an historical and sociological framework for Panzram&#39;s words.</p><p>Thomas E. Gaddis was most noted for his book about convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who was known as the &#34;Birdman of Alcatraz.&#34;</p><h2>God and the Transgender Debate</h2><p>What is transgender and gender fluidity?

What did she know? Gordon Parks is most famous for being the first black director in Hollywood. But before he made movies and wrote books, he was a poor African American looking for work. When he bought a camera, his life changed forever. He taught himself how to take pictures and before long, people noticed. His success as a fashion photographer landed him a job working for the government. In Washington DC, Gordon went looking for a subject, but what he found was segregation. He and others were treated differently because of the color of their skin. Gordon wanted to take a stand against the racism he observed. With his camera in hand, he found a way. Told through lyrical verse and atmospheric art, this is the story of how, with a single photograph, a self-taught artist got America to take notice.</p><p>Carole Boston Weatherford is the author of several acclaimed poetry collections and poetic biographies, including Sugar Hill and Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom, winner of a Caldecott Honor, the Coretta Scott King Award for Illustration, and the NAACP Image Award. She teaches at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina. Jamey Christoph studied illustration at the Ringling College of Art and Design. His illustrations have appeared in a variety of major publications and in several award-winning children&#x2019;s books. He has also received multiple recognitions from the Society of Illustrators and Communication Arts. He works out of his home in Maryland and loves a sunny day on the Eastern Shore with his two crazy dogs, Spencer and Owen.Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;This picture book biography of Gordon Parks highlights the growth of his career as a photographer. Despite receiving little encouragement at school, Parks not only excelled at photography but also wrote novels, penned poetry, and composed music. The rich, varied text ("Boiling mad, Parks vows to lay bare racism with his lens.") is complemented by the illustrations, which sharply contrast Parks's life&#x2014;mostly shown in full color&#x2014;with sketches of his photographs&#x2014;in black-and-white or sepia tones. Parks's career, which began with fashion shots and portraits, took off when he landed a job working for the Farm Security Administration in Washington, DC. There, he became keenly aware of the inequalities between blacks and whites and began to document these differences. When his boss directed him to talk to Ella Watson, a cleaning lady in the building, he photographed her at home with her family and produced his most famous photograph: American Gothic. An author's note provides additional information and includes reproductions of four of Parks's photographs. While the book gets off to a choppy start, moving very rapidly over the photographer's early life, it provides a much-needed portrait of a talented individual and views of his work.

George Mallory, thirty-seven, was Britain&#x2019;s finest climber. Sandy Irvine was a twenty-two-year-old Oxford scholar with little previous mountaineering experience. Neither of them returned.<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on more than a decade of prodigious research, bestselling author and explorer Wade Davis vividly re-creates the heroic efforts of Mallory and his fellow climbers, setting their significant achievements in sweeping historical context: from Britain&#x2019;s nineteen-century imperial ambitions to the war that shaped Mallory&#x2019;s generation. Theirs was a country broken, and the Everest expeditions emerged as a powerful symbol of national redemption and hope. In Davis&#x2019;s rich exploration, he creates a timeless portrait of these remarkable men and their extraordinary times.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011</strong>: It&#x2019;s tempting to call Wade Davis&#x2019;s magnificent <em>Into the Silence</em> an Everest of a book. But that would be misleading. It is more like K2: challenging, technically complex, and hugely rewarding upon completion. The book starts off not with mountaineering, but with vivid, novelistic descriptions of the horrors of the First World War. Years of waste and destruction in the trenches, Davis argues, &#x201c;led a desperate nation to embrace the assault on Everest as a gesture of imperial redemption.&#x201d; Those who endured attempts on the summit all bore the scars of the Great War&#x2014;and they were drawn to the mountain by an almost contradictory desire for conquest and spiritual ablution. At the center of it all is Mallory, whose eventual disappearance effectively closed that chapter in mountaineering. His utterance &#x201c;because it&#x2019;s there&#x201d; became a new war cry, but he climbed for deeper reasons entirely. <em>-- Chris Schluep</em><p><b>Wade Davis</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of fifteen books, including<i>&nbsp;Into the Silence</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i>, and&nbsp;<i>One River,</i>&nbsp;and is an award-winning anthropologist, ethnographer, writer, photographer, and filmmaker.

(Interactive Books for Kids, Preschool Imagination Book, Creativity Books) (Press Here by Herve Tullet)</h2><p><b>An interactive picture book from</b> Herv� Tullet <b>the creator of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Press Here</em> and <em>Mix It Up!</em> </b><br><br><b>Join the magical hunt for one little idea: </b> From one of the true creative geniuses of this generation comes a unique meditation on and celebration of the magic of the birth of a simple idea. Sparkling with visual wit and bubbling with imagination, <em>I Have an Idea!</em> is a richly emotional exploration of the creative process: from an initial tentative inkling, to the frustration of chasing the wrong notion, to finally the exhilaration of capturing&#x2014;and nurturing&#x2014;just the right idea. <em>I Have an Idea!</em> is a scrumptious cloth-spined package of color and inspiration equally at home on a child's bookshelf, in a new graduate's backpack, or atop a creative's desk. <ul><li>The perfect book of color and inspiration for children and those young at heart. </li><li>Answers the questions "how do you find an idea?", "what does it feel like?", "what can you do with an idea?" in a simple and inspiring way. </li><li>Known as the "Prince of Preschool," the versatile Herv� Tullet has been an art director at various ad agencies, a magazine illustrator, and for the past 15 years, a creator of children's books. </li></ul><b>Fans of <em>Beautiful Oops!</em>, <em>The Day the Crayons Quit</em>, and <em>Iggy Peck, Architect</em> will love <em>I Have an Idea</em>!'s introduction to creative thought. </b><br><br><b>The perfect gift to inspire creativity in young readers, new graduates, and budding artists. </b><ul><li>Kids of all ages will turn the pages with anticipation trying to catch that elusive idea</li><li>Books for kids ages 5-8</li><li>Children's picture book for K-3</li></ul></p><p>Herv� Tullet is known for his prodigious versatility, from directing ad campaigns to designing fabric for Herm�s.

He lives in New York City.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;We all have ideas, grown from mysterious origins and frothing with energy. But where do they come from, how do we get them, and what happens when we have them? Tullet's latest offering explores the emotions behind ideas, that ephemeral effervescence that bursts forth at different times in different ways. What Tullet does best is present this emotional journey of an idea in a fun, easily understandable manner with engaging illustrations that seem to pop off of the page. Children (and adults!) will see the origins, progression, and perhaps the end result of an idea in this must-have addition to elementary-level collections. VERDICT Tullet brings the delight and exuberance to the nebulous science of ideas in a way that engages, entertains, and inspires.&#x2014;Amanda C.

Paper artist Robert Sabuda, preeminent patriarch of modern pop-up engineering, brings yet another explosion of motion and color to his latest masterpiece. Attributing animal personalities to nursery-rhyme characters, he surprises young readers time and again. In "Jack Be Nimble," for example, the fellow leaping lithely over a candlestick is none other than a grasshopper. And the Man in the Moon is seen from a startling perspective: he has decidedly alien features! Sabuda's quirky take on traditional rhymes, combined with his fantastic folding, moving, spinning paper sculptures, will have pop-up fanciers and Mother Goose devotees clamoring for more. Sturdier than most pop-ups, these three-dimensional constructions are nonetheless vulnerable to tiny grabbing hands. At his best, Sabuda creates breathtaking displays of pop-up craftsmanship, as in the "four and twenty blackbirds" bursting rowdily out of a pie, mirrored sunglasses on every one. At his worst, he creates slightly bewildering beings, such as the star-shaped Jill in "Jack and Jill" tumbling down a mysterious edifice. He may occasionally (and understandably--what a fun job!) get carried away with his engineering feats. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Robert Sabuda is one of the most innovative and inventive children&#39;s book creators and is known worldwide for his amazing pop-up paper engineering.

My parents were both professors at the University of North Carolina: my mom is a classicist (which means she knows everything you could ever imagine about myths, Latin, and words) and my dad teaches Shakespeare (which means I&#x2019;d seen&nbsp; <i>As You Like It</i>&nbsp;about five times by the age of 18.) I have one brother, who is a musician and lives in California with his son and his wife, an artist who designed my personal website. (Thanks, Mariangeles!) <br> <br> "I&#x2019;ve been writing, in one way or another, for as long as I can remember. I was always a big reader, mostly because my parents were. I used to get frustrated with my mom because she bought me books for Christmas when what I really wanted were the gifts my friends got, things like sweaters and jewelry. But I did love to read. When I was eight or nine my parents gave me an old manual typewriter and a little desk in the corner of our den, and I&#x2019;d sit there and type up my stories. I was the kind of kid that people always sighed over and said, "She has such a wild imagination," which usually meant "I wish Sarah would try to stick to the truth." I have a tendency to embellish: I think it&#x2019;s just a weakness of fiction writers. Once you learn how to make a story better, it&#x2019;s hard not to do it all the time. <br> <br> "In high school, I was lucky enough to have a big group of girlfriends that have really inspired a lot of the stories in my books. I&#x2019;m still close with my friends from that time, so it&#x2019;s never very hard to put myself back into that place, that voice. Also it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to still be living in my hometown, where it&#x2019;s a given that I&#x2019;ll bump into people I had homeroom with, or guys I had big crushes on, while I&#x2019;m pumping gas or buying stamps. It makes it hard to leave high school behind entirely, which is a good or bad thing depending on what day you ask me. I attended college at UNC, where I studied creative writing and graduated with a degree in English. (Which means I can quote small parts of many Great Works. Comes in handy occasionally, like at cocktail parties.) I&#x2019;d been on the five-and-a-half year college plan, and when I graduated my parents were hoping I&#x2019;d settle down and get a Real Job so they could stop worrying about me. But instead of doing the whole resume/pantyhose thing, I decided to stick to my job waiting tables at the world famous Flying Burrito Restaurant and try to publish a novel. At the time, I had only one very bad book I&#x2019;d written my senior year of college and the beginnings of another one. Luckily, my family was supportive and I spent a few years living in a ramshackle little house where I wrote during the day and did the restaurant thing at night. <br> <br> "Three years after graduating, I sold my first book,&nbsp; <b>That Summer</b>, but it wasn&#x2019;t until a year after that that I got offered a teaching job and left waitressing for good. I still miss it sometimes, though. It was a great job for a writer. Endless conversations to eavesdrop, tons of material, and fast money without ever taking work home. Plus, free Mexican food, the best perk of all. Now, I&#x2019;ve published four books, all for young adults. I never really intended to be YA writer, but the second book I showed my agent she thought had a strong teenage voice, so she sent it off to an editor at Orchard Books, who bought it. Even though it was in a way accidental, I&#x2019;ve found that writing for teens suits me. I do short stories, and other novels, that are for an older audience, but again and again I am brought back to the stories of high school. Maybe it&#x2019;s because so much happened to me then that I&#x2019;m not finished yet telling everything. My senior quote was from Pink Floyd (okay, I was a bit of a burnout---I spent a lot of time in the parking lot, whatever, let&#x2019;s move on) and it pretty much summed up my future, although I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time. It was: "The time is gone, the song is over, thought I&#x2019;d something more to say." It turns out that I did. <br> <br> "The books I read when I was teenager, the good ones anyway, have stuck more in my mind than anything since. I still love books, but while I couldn&#x2019;t tell you complete plots of novels I read even six months ago, I do remember even the smallest descriptive details from Lois Lowry&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>A Summer to Die</b>&nbsp;or Judy Blume&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</b>. I think it was because back then books were still somewhat new to me, and when I found an author who seemed to say just what I was feeling, it really struck me and resonated. I hope that my books do that for the people who read them: I think it&#x2019;s the best thing to which any writer can aspire. Now, I teach writing at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I&#x2019;m lucky enough to see my students find their own voice, the way I did in the same program there not so long ago. Teaching is great for me, because I get to show people how writing can really change the way you see not only yourself but the world. I&#x2019;ve found in my own life that if my writing isn&#x2019;t going well, not much else will. It is the one constant, the key to everything else. <br> <br> "As far as my other life, my non-writing life, I live in the country with my husband, some lizards, and two dogs who are completely spoiled and rule me completely. I like to work in my garden---although I have not yet perfected the art of keeping everything alive----and, in my weaker moments, shop. I have a bit of an addiction to the Gap clearance rack, to be honest. I have this strange need to buy huge quantities of black pants. How many pairs of black pants does one person need? (Obviously for me, the answer is 11 and counting. But I digress.) What else can I tell you? I love Starbucks mochas but they make me way hyper. I subscribe to too many magazines. I make a mean bean salad. I could go on, but the truth is, my books are much more exciting than I am, and that&#x2019;s a good thing. It&#x2019;s always more fun to make stuff up anyway." <br>There's a secret to becoming beautiful and confident -- but it's not what you think.<p>While her mother, aerobics queen Kiki Sparks, spends the summer touring Europe, fifteen-year-old Colie is stuck in sleepy Colby, North Carolina, with her aunt Mira. At first, she's sure it's going to be the worst summer of her life -- but she finds herself changing her mind. For one thing, Mira's a sweet, laid-back eccentric; for another, no one in Colby knows that, back home, Colie is seen as a loser -- formerly fat, and "easy". And then, by fate or by accident, Colie lands a waitressing job where she meets Morgan and Isabel. The two wisecracking -- and wise -- twentysomething waitresses help her see herself in a new way and realize the potential that has been there all along. Sarah Dessen's eagerly awaited third novel is better than a Cinderella story -- because, unlike a fairy tale, it could happen to you.</p></p><h2>The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook for Teens: CBT Skills to Help You Deal with Worry and Anxiety (Instant Help)</h2><p><p><b>Today&#x2019;s teens are totally stressed.

Scholarly, informative, well-researched, and well-argued, this will be the best place to begin to ferret out reasons for conflict among Christians who take science seriously.

Scott Oliphint,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Apologetics and Systematic Theology and Dean of Faculty, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Theistic evolution</i> means different things to different people. This book carefully identifies, and thoroughly debunks, an insidious, all-too-commonly accepted sense of the phrase even among Christians: that there is no physical reason to suspect life was designed, and that evolution proceeded in the unguided, unplanned manner Darwin himself championed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael J. Behe,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Biological Sciences, Lehigh University; author, <em>Darwin&#x2019;s Black Box</em> and <em>The Edge of Evolution</em></p><p>&#x201c;Evangelicals are experiencing unprecedented pressure to make peace with the Darwinian theory of evolution, and increasing numbers are waving the white flag. The tragic irony is that evolutionary theory is more beleaguered than ever in the face of multiplying scientific challenges and growing dissent. Until now there has been no consolidated scholarly response to theistic evolution that combines scientific, philosophical, and theological critiques. I was excited to hear about this ambitious project, but the final book has exceeded my expectations. The editors have assembled an impressive cast of experts and the content is top-notch. Theistic evolutionists, and those swayed by their arguments, owe it to themselves to read and digest this compendium of essays. This book is timely and necessary&#x2015;quite literally a godsend.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>James N. Anderson,</strong> Professor of Theology and Philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte</p><p>&#x201c;Repeating the error of medieval Christianity, theistic evolution absolutizes the words of finite, fallible humans and relativizes the Word of an infinite, infallible God. As this tremendous and timely collection thoroughly demonstrates, scientific stagnation, circular philosophy, and heterodox theology are the inevitable results. This is simply the best critique of theistic evolution available.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Angus Menuge,</strong>&nbsp;Chair of Philosophy, Concordia University Wisconsin; President, Evangelical Philosophical Society; author, <em>Agents Under Fire: Materialism and the Rationality of Science</em></p><p>&#x201c;This significant book persuasively argues that theistic evolution fails as a theory&#x2015;scientifically, philosophically, and biblically. And with its broad-ranging collection of essays, it mounts a very impressive case. Strongly recommended, both for those who seek to defend Christianity intelligently and for those who find Christianity implausible because of the claims of neo-Darwinism.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Reeves,</strong> President and Professor of Theology, Union School of Theology, Oxford, UK</p><p>&#x201c;The theistic evolution solution to the creation-evolution controversy herein encounters a substantial, sustained, and trenchant critique. The team of scientific, philosophical, and theological scholars assembled by the editors have joined to confront the venerable theory with a stinging challenge that its adherents will have to answer if they value their scholarly integrity. This is necessary reading for those who wrestle with the great questions surrounding the origins of life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Peter A. Lillback,</strong>&nbsp;President, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;This landmark achievement contains an amazing collection of chapters by a powerful group of fully qualified experts in molecular biology, mathematics, philosophy, and theology. The chapters are clear, detailed in addressing all aspects of theistic evolution, and of a tone in keeping with 1 Peter 3:15: &#x2018;with gentleness and respect.&#x2019; I consider this a must-have book for any Christian who wants to be able to give compelling answers to others who believe in theistic evolution.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Richard A. Carhart,</strong>&nbsp;Professor Emeritus of Physics, University of Illinois at Chicago</p><p>&#x201c;This book offers a much-needed, comprehensive critique of evolutionary creationism (theistic evolution), covering its scientific, philosophical, theological, and biblical deficiencies. It devotes much space in particular to the scientific side. This focus is needed because of the common, unwarranted assumption that Darwinism is doing well as measured by scientific evidence. Several articles, from different angles, show how much Darwinism depends on seeing all biological evidence through the lens of a prior commitment to faith in the philosophy of naturalism&#x2015;particularly the ungrounded assumption that unguided natural forces must suffice as a complete account of origins.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Vern S. Poythress</strong>,&nbsp;Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;In wisdom you have made them all,&#x2019; says the psalmist of God&#x2019;s activities in nature (Ps. 104:24). But believers today, often blinded by modern science, fail to see that divine wisdom. This valuable volume challenges the assumptions of much scientific endeavor and proposes a fresh paradigm that is open to God&#x2019;s involvement in nature. It deserves a wide and thoughtful readership.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gordon Wenham,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of Old Testament, University of Gloucestershire, United Kingdom</p><p>&#x201c;Few scholars even marginally knowledgeable regarding the nature of this debate could read objectively the lineup of scholars in this volume and not be impressed. Beyond the scholars&#x2019; academic credentials, the topics covered are both sophisticated and timely. For this reviewer, the experience caused me to respond time and again: &#x2018;I want to start right there . . . or maybe there . . . wow&#x2015;have to read that one first . . .&#x2019; The topic is not always an easy target, but after almost one thousand pages of critique across interdisciplinary lines, I do not think that it could be bettered. Kudos! Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gary R. Habermas,</strong>&nbsp;Distinguished Research Professor and Chair, Department of Philosophy, Liberty University</p><p>&#x201c;As the debate over the origins of the universe, earth, and humans continues, and Christians grapple to understand the relationship between science and Scripture, evolution and creation, the voices in this book need to be heard. Scientific data need not be in opposition to what the Bible teaches about God and his world. The big questions about life are simply beyond the reach of &#x2018;objective&#x2019; analysis. This volume critiques theologically and philosophically the flaws of positions that marginalize God from the process.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>James Hoffmeier,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Old Testament and Ancient Near Eastern History and Archaeology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Theistic Evolution</i> is a carefully crafted, academically sophisticated interdisciplinary challenge to the attempt to wed Christian theism to any version of the Darwinian project. I am awed by its scope and by the magnificent success of its intentions. Whether your interest is in the scientific deficiencies, the philosophical failings, or the theological dangers of Darwinism hitched to theism, look no further than this thorough analysis. <i>Theistic Evolution</i> is simply the most comprehensive and convincing critique of the topic I&#x2019;ve ever read&#x2015;a singular resource for careful thinkers&#x2015;replacing a dozen books on my shelf.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Gregory Koukl,</strong> President, Stand to Reason; author, <em>The Story of Reality</em> and <em>Tactics</em></p><p>&#x201c;An increasing number of evangelicals are advocating theistic evolution as the best explanation of human origins, thereby denying the special creation of a historical Adam. Without taking any specific view as to the age to the earth, this important new book demonstrates that theistic evolution fails to take proper account of Genesis 1&#x2013;3 as a historical narrative. Leading scholars from a variety of academic disciplines argue that theistic evolution is exegetically ill-founded, theologically damaging, scientifically implausible, and philosophically unjustifiable. Written with an irenic tone toward those it critiques, this book will help guard against false teaching in the church that undermines the gospel and will also provide apologetic help for confident evangelism in a secular world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Stevens,</strong> National Director, The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches</p><p>&#x201c;With the &#x2018;death of God&#x2019; and the &#x2018;hermeneutics of suspicion&#x2019; having captured the academy decades ago, the apologetic discussion moved decisively to the nature and origin of human beings. With this volume, the editors and contributors to <i>Theistic Evolution</i> have given us an important and much-needed resource for the conversation currently taking place within evangelicalism. Comprehensive in its breadth, specific in its critique, and confidently nuanced in its tone, each chapter contributes to a thorough rebuttal of the idea that theistic evolution is compatible with either historic Christian faith, sound reasoning, or rigorous science. But while written by specialists, <i>Theistic Evolution</i> is remarkably approachable to the average reader. I highly recommend this volume to students, pastors, educators, and anyone else who cares deeply about the discussion of human origins. This is a major contribution to one of the most important debates of our time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Lawrence,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland, Oregon; author, <em>Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;Under the banner of &#x2018;theistic evolution,&#x2019; a growing number of Christians maintain that God used evolution as his method for creation. This I believe to be the worst of all possibilities. It is one thing to believe in evolution; it is quite another to blame God for it. Indeed, theistic evolution is a contradiction in terms&#x2015;like the phrase &#x201c;flaming snowflakes.&#x201d; God can no more direct an undirected process than he can create a square circle. Yet this is precisely what theistic evolution presupposes. Modern Christians too often buy high and sell low&#x2015;just as neo-Darwinian evolutionism is fighting for its very life, it is being propped up by an irrational hypothesis. <i>Theistic Evolution</i> is the most thorough and incisive refutation of this dangerous presupposition. I strongly recommend this volume!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Hank Hanegraaff,</strong>&nbsp;President, Christian Research Institute; Host, <em>Bible Answer Man</em> broadcast</p><p>&#x201c;This volume is the most comprehensive study on the relation between evolution and Christian faith I have discovered so far. While opening up fascinating firsthand insights into cutting-edge scientific results, at the same time the book treats the reader to a bird&#x2019;s-eye view, asking the fundamental philosophical and theological questions and delving into the underlying worldview assumptions. It provides a very substantial contribution to the ever-ongoing dispute between naturalism and Christian faith in the areas of philosophy, theology, and the sciences.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Alexander Fink,</strong>&nbsp;Director, Institute for Faith and Sciences, Marburg, Germany</p><p>&#x201c;Essentially, theistic evolution says Charles Darwin and Richard Dawkins got the science right, but that God is still somehow involved. Putting this view into the crosshairs, this book argues convincingly that the science of evolution is in fact wrong, and that any theistic gloss one puts on it is thus doubly wrong.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>William A. Dembski,</strong>&nbsp;Former Senior Fellow, Discovery Institute; author, <em>Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology</em>; <em>The Design Revolution</em>; and <em>Intelligent Design Uncensored</em></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Theistic Evolution</i> is a major contribution to the very lively debate of exactly how to understand the &#x2018;data&#x2019; from God&#x2019;s revelation of himself in his Word with the &#x2018;data&#x2019; from his revelation of himself in his world. Previous contributions to this debate have generally focused on the data from either science or Scripture. <i>Theistic Evolution</i> benefits from its comprehensive analysis from theologians, philosophers, and scientists in the same book. Whatever are your current views, Theistic Evolution will provide analysis from some of the most prominent critics in this conversation that should be helpful to people on both sides of this debate.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Walter Bradley,</strong>&nbsp;Former Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Baylor University</p><p>&#x201c;The question of origins rarely fails to attract interest, not least because it is overloaded with worldview implications.

But when the obsessive need for perfection and control gets in the way of our professional and emotional lives, the cost becomes too high. Although many of us appear cool and confident on the outside, inside we are in emotional turmoil, trying to satisfy everyone, attempting to direct the future, and feeling that we are failing.<br>In TOO PERFECT, Dr. Allan Mallinger draws on twenty years of research and observations from his private practice to show how perfectionism can sap energy, complicate even the simplest decisions, and take the enjoyment out of life. For workaholics or neat freaks, for anyone who fears change or making mistakes, needs rigid rules, is excessively frugal or obstinate, TOO PERFECT offers revealing self-tests, fascinating case histories, and practical strategies to help us overcome obsessiveness and reclaim our right to happiness.</p><p><b>Jeannette Dewyze</b>&nbsp;is a freelance journalist.

We find fault with perfection itself.<br> &#x2014;PASCAL,&nbsp;<br> Pens�es<br> &nbsp;<br> This is a book about people who are too perfect for their own good.<br> &nbsp;<br> You know them. You may be one of them. And if you are, you have much to be proud of. You&#x2019;re one of the solid, good people of the world: honest, reliable, hardworking, responsible, exacting, self-controlled.<br> &nbsp;<br> But for many people there is also a dark side to this perfection. The very traits that bring them success, respect, and trust can also cause them serious problems. These people aren&#x2019;t fully able to savor relationships with others and with the world at large, nor are they at ease with themselves in their universe. Consider:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;The person so driven to meet professional and personal goals that she can&#x2019;t abandon herself to a few hours of undirected leisure without feeling guilty or undisciplined.<br> &nbsp;The person so preoccupied with making the right choice that he has difficulty making even relatively simple decisions usually regarded as pleasurable: buying a new stereo; choosing where to go on vacation.<br> &nbsp;The person so finicky that his pleasure is spoiled if everything isn&#x2019;t &#x201c;just so.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;The &#x201c;thinkaholic&#x201d; whose keen, hyperactive mind all too often bogs her down in painful worry and rumination.<br> &nbsp;The perfectionist, whose need to improve and polish every piece of work chronically causes her to devote much more time than necessary to even inconsequential assignments.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;The person so intent upon finding the ultimate romantic mate that he seems unable to commit to any long-term relationship.<br> &nbsp;The person so acclimated to working long hours that she can&#x2019;t bring herself to cut back, even when confronted with evidence that the overwork is ruining her health or her family relationships.<br> &nbsp;The procrastinator who feels angry at his &#x201c;laziness&#x201d;&#x2014;unaware that the real reason he is unable to undertake tasks is that his need to do them flawlessly makes them loom impossibly large.<br> &nbsp;<br> These are just a few of the behaviors common to people who have the personality type that psychiatrists call obsessive. This term and the related term, compulsive, have crept into our everyday language to a striking degree. This person is &#x201c;obsessed&#x201d; with baseball. That one is a &#x201c;compulsive&#x201d; shopper. Recent articles and books have also made the lay public aware of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the malady that drives its sufferers to such acts as repeated hand-washing, checking routines, or other paralyzing rituals.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I use the term obsessive, however, I mean something quite different. I&#x2019;m referring to a personality type, not to an isolated behavior or clinical disorder like OCD.<br> &nbsp;<br> If there is a single quality that characterizes obsessive people it is a powerful, unconscious need to feel in control&#x2014;of themselves, of others, and of life&#x2019;s risks. One of the primary ways in which this need manifests itself is perfectionism. A whole family of personality traits is rooted in these two needs&#x2014;to be in control and to be &#x201c;perfect.&#x201d; These include:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;a fear of making errors<br> &nbsp;a fear of making a wrong decision or choice<br> &nbsp;a strong devotion to work<br> &nbsp;a need for order or firmly established routine<br> &nbsp;frugality<br> &nbsp;a need to know and follow the rules<br> &nbsp;emotional guardedness<br> &nbsp;a tendency to be stubborn or oppositional<br> &nbsp;a heightened sensitivity to being pressured or controlled by others<br> &nbsp;an inclination to worry, ruminate, or doubt<br> &nbsp;a need to be above criticism&#x2014;moral, professional, or personal<br> &nbsp;cautiousness<br> &nbsp;a chronic inner pressure to use every minute productively<br> &nbsp;<br> By my definition, someone is obsessive if his or her personality is predominantly colored by traits from this family&#x2014;in any combination. Many of these traits, when they aren&#x2019;t exaggerated or rigid, are valuable qualities. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine someone succeeding in our society today without some degree of self-discipline, for example, or some desire to work hard and avoid errors. But some people are &#x201c;too perfect.&#x201d; The obsessive traits in their personality are so dominant and inflexible that these virtues actually cause a host of problems.<br> &nbsp;<br> In my practice I see new examples of such self-generated anguish every day. And at the same time I see how unaware most obsessives are that they&#x2019;re harming themselves; they recoil from any hint that their heavy burdens could be self-imposed. Most have grown up believing that you can never be too careful, hardworking, thorough, prepared, or organized. In fact, they&#x2019;re often proudest of the very traits that cause them the most harm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rarely do my obsessive patients come to me because they feel there&#x2019;s anything wrong with their attitudes or lifestyles. Instead they come seeking help with some specific symptom or external stressor. Maybe they&#x2019;ve begun suffering from baffling anxiety or gastrointestinal ailments. Or they may be having trouble coping with some distressing life event: a serious career reversal or a work block that threatens their urgent heed to achieve. Often a spouse or lover has insisted that they get some help.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Laura&#x2019;s case, it was her internist&#x2019;s suggestion that led her to me. For months this patient had felt drained of any joy or zest for life, and her sleep and appetite both were suffering. Laura initially felt baffled by her inability to simply shake off her feelings of sadness. But she was a bright, sensitive, insightful person, and was quickly able to isolate several factors that were feeding her melancholy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much of Laura&#x2019;s self-esteem was inextricably intertwined with her image of herself as an achiever who invariably dazzled people with her accomplishments. The exemplary child of prominent professionals, she had graduated with top honors from a prestigious Eastern university, then had embarked on a business career in which she swiftly rose to become the marketing director for a highly successful new clothing retailer. Almost immediately, people within her company came to think of Laura as someone who could handle any problem or shoulder any task, no matter how difficult.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her private life, however, was another matter. She was unhappy with her marriage and had been thinking about getting a divorce, but she felt terribly frustrated by her inability to make a final decision. She also felt totally burned out by her job. Because she had trouble delegating tasks and felt she had to be all things to all people, she really did have a crushing work load, which was made even more onerous by the incredibly high standards by which she judged her own work. Once Laura told me that she felt truly relaxed only when she was in a darkened movie theater. Even at home, she was constantly either working or feeling guilty about ignoring one chore or another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Clearly, Laura had reasons to feel troubled, but she didn&#x2019;t realize that she could behave any differently. It took time and effort for her to see how much she was contributing to her own misery. As I got to know her, I learned that Laura&#x2019;s father had been a picky, judgmental man with inflexible views on the &#x201c;right&#x201d; way to do everything. Laura thus grew up believing that in order to earn her father&#x2019;s love (an almost impossible task, since he was so hard to please), she had to perform flawlessly. As an adult, Laura&#x2019;s continuing abhorrence of making mistakes was preventing her from taking action in her marriage, and was vastly complicating her work life. At the same time, her unremitting self-criticism soured her ability to truly enjoy any of her own substantial achievements.<br> &nbsp;<br> Raymond, a surgeon in a university hospital, came to see me only at the insistence of his wife, Abbe, a corporate architect. Married for fifteen years, both were workaholics who had grown used to spending most of their time apart. When I met the two of them, Abbe had encountered a career crisis and needed support from her husband&#x2014;support that she felt was totally absent. Abbe also charged that her domineering husband constantly &#x201c;bullied&#x201d; her&#x2014;passing judgment on everything from her cooking to her political opinions. As a result she had come to feel chronically inhibited and constrained in her own home. Even more disturbing to her was the extent to which Raymond failed to share his feelings with her. Not only did she feel no sense of intimacy with him, she felt unloved and terribly lonely.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was true, Raymond acknowledged, that he had trouble trusting people, even people he loved. He justified this distrustfulness by recalling the various individuals who had let him down over the years. Raymond&#x2019;s childhood offered further clues into his guardedness. His father had been a stern and critical man who never seemed appreciative of any of his son&#x2019;s many achievements. To protect himself from crushing feelings of rejection, Raymond had, early on, developed a thick shell. But Raymond insisted that he did care about his wife and she should know it; her needs for more overt displays of affection from him were just indications of her own insecurity. For every one of her specific criticisms he had a forceful, eloquent defense.<br> &nbsp;<br> After just three sessions, Raymond canceled our meetings, saying he would reschedule another appointment soon. I didn&#x2019;t hear from him again, however, until several months later. It was hard to reconcile the anguished voice on the phone with the aloof, intimidating figure I had met before. When he arrived at the office, Raymond told me that he had lost twenty pounds and admitted he was seriously contemplating suicide. Abbe had openly embarked upon an affair with another man and Raymond was absolutely devastated at the prospect of losing her. Nothing else in his life was as important as she was, he told me, weeping. If he had to change, somehow, in order to win her back, then he would try to change. But I could see that Raymond still didn&#x2019;t fully understand that his own perfectionism, guardedness, and need for control had helped set him up for this personal tragedy. We met for several sessions and he did appear to make some progress, but then he once again abruptly dropped out of therapy.</p><h2>Swamp Santa (Miss Fortune Mysteries)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s Christmas in Sinful and Fortune is set to participate in all the local hoopla.

Are you ready for a glimpse into the dark, subterranean world of the star-nosed mole? A barred owl&#x2019;s late-winter call to take on new meaning? The life cycle of the eastern newt to suddenly seem complex, beautiful, and intricately bound to mysterious underwater landscapes and damp forest floors? Naturalist and environmental educator Mary Holland&#x2019;s visually astounding book <i>Naturally Curious</i> promises a walk in the woods (or a field or wetland) will never be the same.<p>With boundless enthusiasm and a lifetime&#x2019;s-worth of natural history knowledge, Holland escorts you through the New England seasons, month by month&#x2015;in sun, rain, and snow; along roadsides and riverbanks; above burrows and under treetop nesting sites. Beginning with March and its early stirrings of life &#x201c;awakening&#x201d; after a long cold winter, and ending in February as survival becomes the sole focus of all plants and creatures, great and small, Holland provides hundreds of fascinating &#x201c;Nature Notes.&#x201d; These bite-size nuggets of fact-based information detail a species&#x2019; actions in a particular month&#x2015;whether courting, breeding, singing, burrowing, migrating, or caching food, for example. In addition, you&#x2019;ll find pertinent lists of the amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, insects and arachnids, and plants and fungi you might expect to see or hear from as the weeks go by.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not all: Each month culminates in specially chosen essays, where Holland gets up-close-and-personal with New England plant and animal life and some of their more intriguing typicalities and peculiarities, illustrating their impact on the region and those who share it. Throughout, the many exciting and varied &#x201c;worlds&#x201d; of the Northeast explode upon the page in an unmatched visual display of full-color photographs. From the minutiae (the migration of the tiny snow flea on a warm winter&#x2019;s day) to the massive (the wallowing practices of the bull moose in rut) this is the region and its inhabitants like you&#x2019;ve never seen them before.</p><p>By deftly melding the practical field guide we all need with the kind of book we all want to sit back and read, Holland does New England&#x2015;and those who live in it, visit it, and love it&#x2015;an immense service. Adults and children alike are sure to be fascinated by the natural world in this book, in their backyard, and even further afield. <i>Naturally Curious</i> is truly an &#x201c;into this world&#x201d; experience.</p></p><p><b>Mary Holland</b> is a Vermont naturalist, photographer, columnist, and author.

She was waking up. Took her long enough.<br><br> He took a drag on his cigarette and blew the smoke into her face. A coughing fit ensued and by the time she&#x2019;d calmed down, her dark eyes were open and staring up at him.<br><br> She was scared. This pleased him. He smiled down at her. They were always scared and this always pleased him.<br><br> He sat back in his chair, watching as she struggled against her bonds. They always did that, too. But they never got free. He tied a very strong knot. It was one of his best talents.<br><br> He waited until she&#x2019;d given up, until her gaze fixed on his face and recognition set in. &#x201c;You,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;From the diner.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Me,&#x201d; he replied agreeably. From the tired old diner on the outskirts of Portland. Getting her home had been a pain in the ass. She took up much more space than he&#x2019;d expected. She was curvier than most of the guests he brought home. It would be a nice change.<br><br> She yanked on her bonds again, a token effort only. Her lips trembled. &#x201c;Where are my clothes?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Burned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br> He stood up, pulled lazily at his tie, aware that she was following his every move. &#x201c;Because you won&#x2019;t be needing them anymore.&#x201d;<br><br> She shook her head, appropriately agitated. &#x201c;Why are you doing this?&#x201d;<br><br> He unbuttoned his shirt as her eyes flicked all around the room, looking for help. Looking for escape. There would be none. He grabbed her hand from where he&#x2019;d tied it to the headboard and ran his thumb over her left ring finger, following the indentation that was all that remained of her wedding vows.<br><br> &#x201c;Does he know you&#x2019;re gone?&#x201d; he asked softly.<br><br> Her gaze flew to her ring finger and she tried to pull her hand away, but, of course, she couldn&#x2019;t. Slowly she nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;Did he let you go?&#x201d;<br><br> Another nod, but her eyes flickered away. He squeezed her hand hard enough to make her gasp. &#x201c;Do not lie to me, Miriam.&#x201d;<br><br> He was surprised when her eyes flared with a sudden fury. &#x201c;That is not my name,&#x201d; she ground out. &#x201c;My name is Eileen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The locket says Miriam.&#x201d; He held up the heart-shaped silver charm, letting it dangle between them, watching it gleam as it caught the low light from the bedside lamp. He set it to swing, like a hypnotist&#x2019;s watch. &#x201c;Did you steal it?&#x201d;<br><br> She swallowed hard, momentarily mesmerized by the swinging locket. Then her jaw hardened. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then, if it&#x2019;s yours, you are Miriam.&#x201d;<br><br> She closed her eyes. &#x201c;No, I am not.&#x201d;<br><br> It was really immaterial at this point, but her little show of temper had intrigued him. &#x201c;Then who is Miriam?&#x201d;<br><br> A tear ran down her cheek. &#x201c;Who I used to be.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. So your husband is looking for Miriam. Not Eileen.&#x201d;<br><br> She clamped her lips shut, giving him his answer.<br><br> Good. He hadn&#x2019;t been terribly worried that anyone would be tracking her down. The woman had a solitary, hunted air to her, like she always looked over her shoulder. Like she was hiding. That worked for him.<br><br> He ran his thumb over the locket, feeling the etched lines of the engraved Miriam on the back, then the symbol on the front. &#x201c;An olive tree, two kneeling children, all protected by these beautiful outstretched angel wings.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d winced at the word &#x201c;protected.&#x201d; If it had been a talisman, it was a piss-poor one. It certainly hadn&#x2019;t protected her. &#x201c;What does it mean?&#x201d;<br><br> Again her jaw tightened and she looked away. He gripped her chin and yanked her back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ignore me,&#x201d; he warned.<br><br> She clenched her eyes shut, so he covered her mouth and pinched her nose closed. &#x201c;Look at me,&#x201d; he growled, all fascination with her gone. He was angry again, which was how it was supposed to be. Her eyes flew open, terrified as she began to struggle to get free. He removed his hand and allowed her to breathe, smiling at her frantic gasps for air.<br><br> He gripped her chin again, much harder this time. &#x201c;Say you&#x2019;re sorry, Miriam.&#x201d; He gave her a hard shake. &#x201c;Say you&#x2019;re sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> Stubbornly she clamped her lips together.<br><br> His lips curved. Excellent. He&#x2019;d make her say it before he was through and he&#x2019;d enjoy every moment of the effort. Because they always said it, sooner or later.<br><br> Usually as they begged him to let them die. <br><br><b> Chapter One<br> Sacramento, California<br> Thursday, February 16, 8:15 p.m.</b><br><br> &#x201c;Daisy?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy Dawson flinched when Trish&#x2019;s finger poked her upper arm. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked, knowing she&#x2019;d been distracted. She returned her attention to her friend, who&#x2019;d stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, a worried expression on her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. What did you say?&#x201d;<br><br> Trish frowned. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you tonight? You&#x2019;re jumpy. Is it because of Gus? Do I need to call Rosemary?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy rolled her shoulders, trying to relieve the tension in her muscles. It didn&#x2019;t relax her any more than it eliminated the tickle at the back of her neck. Because someone was watching her. Following her.<br><br> Again. Thanks a lot for keeping your word, Dad, she thought bitterly. She&#x2019;d thought they&#x2019;d had an agreement. She&#x2019;d thought he trusted her. She&#x2019;d been wrong. Again. She wanted to scream, to rage. To call him right now and tell him to stay the fuck out of her life.<br><br> A rough, wet tongue licking her fingers had her tamping her temper down. Absently she reached into the pet sling that she wore cross-body and scratched behind Brutus&#x2019;s enormous wing-shaped ears. &#x201c;Shh, girl,&#x201d; she murmured, and the dog immediately settled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m okay. Which wasn&#x2019;t exactly true, not that Brutus would believe her anyway. The little dog knew when she was spiraling, knew when she was on edge, and did what she&#x2019;d been trained to do&#x2014;distracting Daisy before her spiral became a meltdown. Drawing a breath, she smiled tightly for Trish&#x2019;s benefit. &#x201c;No, let Rosemary go home to her family. She&#x2019;s earned it.&#x201d;<br><br> Because tonight had been a hard night for all of them, especially Rosemary.<br><br> Trish&#x2019;s eyes welled with new tears that she didn&#x2019;t try to hide. It was just the two of them and Trish knew she didn&#x2019;t have to pretend around Daisy. &#x201c;Poor Gus.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Keeping one hand on Brutus, Daisy lifted her other hand to Trish&#x2019;s face to wipe away the tears. &#x201c;I guess he just couldn&#x2019;t handle the grief of losing his wife.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe he didn&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Trish whispered.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; All Daisy knew was that the man&#x2019;s death from alcohol poisoning had hit Rosemary hard. Seeing their sponsor cry like that as she&#x2019;d told them of Gus&#x2019;s death had left Daisy shaken and feeling helpless. Daisy hated feeling helpless.<br><br> Trish bit at her lip. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d been sober for fifteen years, DD. Fifteen years. He was a sponsor even. He was Rosemary&#x2019;s sponsor. How can we expect to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy cut her off by pressing a finger to Trish&#x2019;s lips. &#x201c;Stop. You cannot compare yourself to Gus or anyone else. He was grieving. His wife died. They&#x2019;d been married for fifty years. You said it yourself&#x2014;maybe he wanted to die. Maybe this was just his way.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish nodded shakily. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She straightened her shoulders and took a swipe at each eye with her sleeve. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy gave her a one-armed hug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m usually right.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish snorted. &#x201c;You wish.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy laughed. &#x201c;If I said we needed hot fudge sundaes with extra nuts, would I be right about that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s a given. We always have sundaes after a meeting.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy linked arms with Trish and they began walking toward the diner where their sundaes awaited. &#x201c;What were you saying before?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh. I wanted to know if you were volunteering this weekend at the pet store.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am.&#x201d; Daisy smiled up at Trish, who was at least five inches taller. &#x201c;Are you wanting to volunteer or adopt?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Adopt?&#x201d; Trish said it more as a question. &#x201c;I was thinking about a cat. Something to come home to, but not something I&#x2019;d have to walk. Not with my crazy schedule.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a great idea. So does Brutus, don&#x2019;t you, girl?&#x201d; Brutus popped her head out of the sling that doubled as Daisy&#x2019;s handbag, her tongue out in the cutest way possible. &#x201c;See? She says yes.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish laughed. &#x201c;Of course she does. She&#x2019;s biased, though, coming from the shelter herself. You really lucked out, finding a Chion puppy at a shelter. She is a Chion, right? I looked up Papillon-Chihuahua mixes. That&#x2019;s what the article called them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Some people call them Papihuahuas,&#x201d; Daisy said. Whatever breed she was called, Brutus was perfect and necessary. &#x201c;My dad found her, actually, while I was in rehab. One of the therapists had a service dog that helped him control his anxiety, which helped him maintain his sobriety. Dad went looking for a dog that could be trained to do the same for me when I got out. She was the runt of the litter, which was why I named her Brutus. She was so tiny that I figured she needed all the help she could get.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wondered about her name. Although she looks like a Gizmo to me.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy laughed. With her large bat ears, Brutus did look like the little creature from Gremlins. &#x201c;She does. Before the gremlins turned evil, that is. Gizmo was my sister Julie&#x2019;s suggestion when Dad first brought her home.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If I could find a dog this little and this cute, I might rethink a cat, but I couldn&#x2019;t bring a dog to work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, not where you work now. Which we need to change,&#x201d; Daisy said firmly. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t work in a bar. You&#x2019;re not being fair to yourself, Trish.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m looking. I&#x2019;ve got applications out everywhere. It&#x2019;s not just having the booze all around me. It&#x2019;s also the drunken, grabby assholes who do not take no for an answer. I really hate them.&#x201d;<br> Daisy frowned at that. &#x201c;Is somebody bothering you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not really. There was a guy today who was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. belligerent. Just wouldn&#x2019;t take no for an answer. I stopped smiling when he &#x2018;accidentally&#x2019; brushed his hand over my ass. Told him that I&#x2019;d have him thrown out. He got mean after that, insulting me. A real tool, you know?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Oh, I know.&#x201d; Because her cohost at the radio station was the same way.<br> Trish frowned. &#x201c;Is Tad bothering you again?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy shrugged. Trish was the only person she&#x2019;d told about the smarmy Tad. &#x201c;Same old, same old. Little digs, meant to throw me off my game. I can handle Tad, for now anyway. If the time comes when I can&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll report him. Did you report this guy who bothered you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I did. I had to. My manager finally did throw him out. The guy kept baiting me, like he wanted me to react. Normally I&#x2019;d just wave that off, but I was on edge to start with. I had a big test this morning and I&#x2019;m not sure how I did.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help you look at the job listings when I&#x2019;m done at the pet store adoption clinic on Saturday.&#x201d; A new job for Trish didn&#x2019;t need to be permanent, just not at a bar. When she finished dental assistant school, she&#x2019;d be able to get a good job. &#x201c;I checked again at the radio station, but they&#x2019;re not hiring right now.&#x201d;<br><br> Which made Daisy wince, because she knew that she&#x2019;d only been hired because her boss and her father were old friends. It was something that Tad never let her forget. Which was why she hadn&#x2019;t yet reported him. She didn&#x2019;t want to give him any more ammunition against her.<br> &#x201c;I appreciate you asking anyway,&#x201d; Trish said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> A sound behind them had Daisy stopping abruptly once again. It was a shuffle, the scrape of a shoe on concrete. A quick glance over her shoulder showed a familiar-looking man wearing a baseball cap ducking into an alley. Dad&#x2019;s losing his touch. He used to be able to hire people she couldn&#x2019;t see or hear.<br><br> Trish was frowning again. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy lowered her voice to barely a whisper. &#x201c;My dad&#x2019;s having me followed again. I can hear the guy behind us.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish&#x2019;s frown deepened. &#x201c;Again?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Daisy said grimly. &#x201c;He hired a guy to follow me when I was backpacking across Europe last summer. Pissed me off so bad that I came back early and Dad and I had it out. He promised never to do that to me again, but I guess he doesn&#x2019;t trust me after all.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He had you followed?&#x201d; Trish asked, dumbfounded. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He was worried I&#x2019;d fall off the wagon. That&#x2019;s what he said, anyway.&#x201d; Daisy still had her doubts, thinking it was more about her father&#x2019;s inability to break from a lifetime of paranoia. It had killed her sister. It nearly killed me. It had certainly stolen what had remained of her childhood. She wasn&#x2019;t going to allow it to ruin her life, no manner how well-meaning her father&#x2019;s intentions might be.<br><br> Trish made a face. &#x201c;Pretty ironic seeing as the guy is following you from an AA meeting. Do you know who it is?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Yeah. It&#x2019;s our old ranch hand, Jacob. We grew up together. He&#x2019;s like the brother I never had, but I&#x2019;m still going to kick his ass.&#x201d; Which she&#x2019;d done when she&#x2019;d caught him lurking in the shadows of a Paris alley, much as he was doing now.<br><br> Trish&#x2019;s lips twitched. &#x201c;Can I watch? My cable&#x2019;s been out for two months.&#x201d; She made another face. &#x201c;The cable people apparently like to be paid.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy patted her shoulder in sympathy. Trish barely made a living wage at the bar. &#x201c;Go to the diner and put in our order. I&#x2019;ll meet you there.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish shook her head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if he is your friend. I&#x2019;m not leaving you alone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine. Jacob is a like a cuddly lamb. A six-foot-two-inch, two-hundred-pound lamb. Seriously, he wouldn&#x2019;t hurt a fly. Go on. I&#x2019;ll meet you there in a few minutes.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy briefly considered confronting Jacob in the alley, but annoyance had her following the path Trish had taken, then veering off to quickly duck into an alley of her own. Jacob deserved to have the shit scared out of him for following her again. He&#x2019;d promised to let her live her life independently, just as her father had.<br><br> She ground her teeth. Damn them both. She was not a child. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to be one. She was twenty-five years old, living on her own and doing just fine, all by herself. Well, not by herself, but with the support of people she&#x2019;d chosen for the job.<br><br> She heard Jacob&#x2019;s footsteps seconds before he passed by. Leaping from the alley, she grabbed a handful of his bulky padded jacket and yanked him back. He spun around in surprise, the brim of his baseball cap hiding his face.<br><br> &#x201c;The Giants?&#x201d; she mocked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the best disguise you could manage? You thought I wouldn&#x2019;t notice you because you&#x2019;re wearing a Giants cap?&#x201d; Because he&#x2019;d never be caught dead wearing a Giants anything. They were both Oakland fans.<br><br> She reached up and snatched the cap from his head, realizing only a millisecond later that she&#x2019;d hadn&#x2019;t had to reach up far enough. He was too short.<br><br> Because he wasn&#x2019;t Jacob.<br><br> She took a step back, the gasp stuck in her throat, her pulse instantly going supersonic as the man glared down at her, his dark eyes barely visible behind the nylon stocking covering his face. Distorting his features.<br><br> She turned to run, but it was too late. His arm wrapped around her throat, yanking h...</p><h2>W.I.T.C.H.: The Graphic Novel, Part I.

However, most of his philosophical writings could be found only within the personal library of the Bruce Lee estate--until now. <i>The Warrior Within</i> is the most comprehensive volume of these teachings, meant to help you apply Lee's philosophies to your own life. This unique guide reveals such life-affirming secrets as:</p><p>Seeing the totality of life and putting things into perspective</p><p>Understanding the concept of Yin and Yang</p><p>Defeating adversity by adapting to circumstances</p><p>Tapping into inner spiritual forces to help shape the future</p><p>With a foreword by his wife, Linda Lee Cadwell and photographs and other memorabilia from Bruce Lee's short but celebrated life, <i>The Warrior Within</i> is an engrossing and easy-to-understand guide to the little-explored world of Bruce Lee.</p></p><p><p><b>John Little</b> has been identified as "one of the foremost authorities on Bruce Lee in the world" by <i>Black Belt</i> magazine. He edited a three-volume series for the Bruce Lee estate and has written articles for several publications, including <i>Men's Fitness, Official Karate</i>, and <i>Inside Kung Fu</i>. Little is uniquely suited to the task of relating the philosophy of Bruce Lee and his approach to life. He has a degree in philosophy from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, is the author of two books on health and fitness (having spent over fifteen years as a writer for several fitness magazines), and is himself a student of Lee's art of Jeet Kune Do.</p><p>Selected by the Bruce Lee estate, Little is the only person who has ever been authorized to review the entirety of Lee's personal notes, sketches, and reading annotations and to edit books on the subject of Lee's martial art and its far-reaching philosophical underpinnings. Little's keen awareness of the subtleties of both Eastern and Western philosophy coupled with a respect for the preservation of the essence of Lee's words and meaning give this book an integrity that is all too rare.</p>While Bruce Lee is generally thought of as a martial arts specialist who made movies and at 33 died under mysterious circumstances, his public perception does not usually include that of a master philosopher. Little (Precision Training: The New Method To Achieve Optimum Muscularity, Power Factor Pub., 1995) attempts to remedy that in this compelling and interesting book, written with the blessing of Lee's estate. A student of Lee's "jeet kune do" form of martial art, Little was given access to heretofore unreleased personal notes, sketches, and reading annotations. What is revealed is a man who read extensively and was well versed in the philosophies of both East and West. Little arranges his narrative under such headings as "See the Totality," "Defeating Adversity," and "The Warrior Within." There is also an excerpt from an interview Little conducted with the late Brandon Lee (Bruce's son), as well as appendixes detailing Lee's principal works and a chronology of his life. While not an essential purchase, it is a worthwhile addition to public library collections.?David M. Turkalo, Suffolk Univ.

They&#x2019;re a piece of every town, and usually they&#x2019;re not much to look at: worn countertops, free refills on coffee, an everyman&#x2019;s clientele. Typically the genre doesn&#x2019;t offer much in the way of memorable cuisine, but it delivers a sense of dependability.&nbsp;It seems like everybody I know has a soft spot for some diner, somewhere. Perhaps it provided refuge on a late-night road trip, or it has the only breakfast that will cure your hangover. Maybe it&#x2019;s the place you went on Sundays with your grandparents. As one of the most accessible forms of restaurant, diners are places where strangers can find familiarity through food, whether it&#x2019;s meatloaf and mashed potatoes, &nbsp;a straightforward burger, or chicken potpie.&nbsp; <br><br>This is the story of one such diner and of the people and food that belong to it.&nbsp;<br><b>Oyster Stew with Twice-Fried Saltines and Charred Turnip Relish</b><br><br>The secret to this rich, indulgent stew is only partially in the cream. Oysters are pureed into the base, which connects their briny salinity to the rest of the ingredients and naturally thickens the soup. It builds an undeniably oystery backbone. The turnips provide a sharp, wasabi-like heat that brings the luxurious richness of the soup back into balance. I&#x2019;ve always loved the oyster crackers that come alongside a bowl of chowder. The fried saltines operate along the same principle, but are even more delicious. <br>SERVES 8<br><br>CHARRED TURNIP RELISH<br> 1 tablespoon neutral vegetable oil<br> 4 ounces turnip greens<br> Sea salt<br> 1 tablespoon minced shallot<br> Zest of 1&#x2044;2 lemon<br> 3&#x2044;4 cup extra virgin olive oil<br><br>OYSTER STEW<br> 3 cups shucked oysters in their liquid (about 30 oysters)<br> 2 tablespoons neutral vegetable oil<br> 2 cups thinly sliced yellow onions (about 1 medium onion)<br> 2 cups thinly sliced fennel (about 1 bulb)<br> 2 cups diced turnip (about 2 small turnips)<br> 2 cloves garlic, crushed<br> A large sachet&nbsp;<br> 1 tablespoon sea salt<br> 1 cup white wine<br> 1 cup dry vermouth<br> 6 cups heavy cream<br> 1 cup Dijon mustard<br><br>TWICE-FRIED SALTINES<br> Neutral vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1 sleeve saltines<br><br>To make the relish, add the oil to a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. When it&#x2019;s hot, add the greens and cook, flipping the leaves occasionally, until they have a nice sear on them, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and transfer to a cutting board or baking sheet to cool. Once cool, finely chop the greens and place in a medium bowl. Fold in the shallot and lemon zest, then mix in the olive oil. Refrigerate until ready to use.&nbsp;<br><br>Place the oysters in a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl and drain well.<br><br>Place a large saucepot or Dutch oven over medium heat and add the oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the onions, fennel, turnip, and garlic. Reduce the heat and sweat until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the sachet and salt. Stir until you can smell the herbs in the sachet.<br><br>Add the white wine and vermouth and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower to a simmer and reduce the liquid by half. Add 1 cup of the drained oysters, the juice that has collected in the bowl, the cream, and the mustard. Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 10 minutes. Discard the sachet.<br><br>While the stew is simmering, make the saltines. Line a plate with paper towels. Heat 1&#x2044;2 inch of oil in a skillet over high heat. When the oil reaches 325�F on a deep-fry thermometer, add the saltines in batches of 6 crackers and fry, turning frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes, until tanned. Transfer to the plate and reserve.<br><br>Using an immersion blender or food processor, puree the stew mixture until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and return the liquid to the pot. (You can prepare the stew up to this step up to 1 day before.) Place over medium heat; add the remaining drained oysters and stir, cooking for just 1 or 2 minutes more to warm the oysters. Ladle into bowls and serve with the twice-fried saltines broken up over the top and a dollop of relish.</p><h2>Purrfect Murder (The Mysteries of Max)</h2><p>There&#x2019;s something special about Max. He may look like your regular ginger flabby tabby, but unlike most tabbies, he can actually communicate with his human, reporter for the Hampton Cove Gazette Odelia Poole. Max takes a keen interest in the goings-on in their small town, by snooping around with his best friends Dooley, a not-too-bright ragamuffin, and Harriet, a gorgeous white Persian. Their regular visits to the police station, the barbershop and the doctor&#x2019;s office provide them with those precious and exclusive scoops that have made Odelia the number one reporter in town. But when suddenly the body of a bestselling writer is discovered buried in the last Long Island outhouse, and a new policeman arrives in town to solve the murder, it looks like things are about to change in Hampton Cove. Detective Chase Kingsley doesn&#x2019;t take kindly to nosy reporters like Odelia snooping around his crime scene or interviewing his suspects. And to make matters worse, he&#x2019;s got a cat of his own in Brutus, a buff, black bully, who, just like his owner, likes to lay down the law. Soon Brutus isn&#x2019;t just restricting access to the police station, but he&#x2019;s putting the moves on Harriet, breaking up the band.

In the latest book in the Horse Diaries series, meet Lily, a strawberry roan Welsh pony with a competitive heart!</b></b><br><br>SOUTH WALES, 1939: Lily, a strawberry roan Welsh pony, loves Pony Club! She and her rider, Gwen, compete in and win lots of events, including Lily's favorite--jumping! Then Bridget joins the Pony Club. The English girl was sent from London to escape the bombings brought on by war. Gwen tries to be friends, but Bridget is sour and mean. Even worse, Bridget and her horse, Bron, make the perfect jump look easy. Now Gwen and Lily have some real competition. . . .</p><p>WHITNEY SANDERSON has loved horses since she was a child, riding in a 4-H club and reading series like The Saddle Club and The Black Stallion. In addition to always having a horse or two in the backyard, she grew up surrounded by beautiful equine artwork created by her mother, Horse Diaries illustrator Ruth Sanderson. Visit whitneysanderson.com to find out more.<br><br>RUTH SANDERSON has illustrated books for children of all ages, including <i>Summer Pony</i>, <i>Winter Pony</i>, and <i>Hush, Little Horsie</i>. She lives with her family in Ware, Massachusetts, and her favorite hobby is horseback riding.&nbsp;<br> B<i>ang! </i>The cork gun fired in the air, and I leaped forward into a gallop. The noise had spooked me, but I didn&#x2019;t break stride. Apricot&#x2019;s bright eye gleamed beside mine, keeping pace with me. Not far behind, I heard the rhythmic snorting of the&nbsp;cob mare from the South Notts team.<br> At our home meets in Carmarthenshire, the starter always dropped a flag to begin a race. But today we were guests of the Eridge Hunt Pony Club, over the border in Sussex, England. This was fox-hunting country, and the ponies here were used to the sound of a gunshot.<br> I focused ahead, to the wooden buckets standing in a row at the end of the roped-off meadow. My ten-year-old rider, Gwen, slowed me as we drew near. She kicked her feet out of the stirrups and slid down from my back before I had fully halted.<br> &#x201c;Whoa, Lily, stand,&#x201d; she said. I was riled from the race, so I couldn&#x2019;t help pawing the grass a little. But I didn&#x2019;t <i>really </i>move from the spot.<br> Holding my reins in one hand, Gwen kneeled&nbsp;in front of a bucket brimming with water and apples. She plunged her face into the water. I couldn&#x2019;t help wishing it were the ponies, not the riders, who competed in this part of the game. I&#x2019;d have gotten two or three apples by now!&nbsp;<br> Apricot&#x2019;s rider, Susan Padmore, was bobbing for an apple, too. I wished Gwen would hurry up. Apricot was my rival on the Eridge Hunt team. She was a fine-boned chestnut mare who looked, and ran, like a miniature Thoroughbred. She had won the Pony Jumper championship at the summer rally. Now I was eager to even the score.&nbsp;<br> At last Gwen lifted her dripping face from the bucket. She had an apple clenched in her teeth. A moment later Susan bit into an apple, too. Almost at the same time, the two girls mounted and galloped us back across the meadow.&nbsp;<br> Apricot and I were neck and neck again. We could have been hitched in the same harness. I strained to lengthen my stride. Inch by inch, I managed to pull ahead&#x2014;and nearly crashed into my teammate&#x2019;s rump as we crossed the finish line.&nbsp;<br> <i>Good show, Lily! You looked ready to race in the Epsom Oaks. </i>Cadfael, a bright bay Welsh&nbsp;Mountain pony, reached out and gave me a friendly nip on the flank.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stop being a beast, Caddy!&#x201d; His rider, Gwen&#x2019;s best friend, Rhiannon Kiffin, tugged his reins to turn his head away from me. But Cadfael wasn&#x2019;t being mean. It was just his nature to nibble on everything. Nearby, fussy Arian laid back his ears.&nbsp;He wore the red ribbon of a kicker in his tail, so everyone knew not to pass too close behind him.&nbsp;<br> Gwen dropped her apple into a bucket near the finish line. The next pair, Catrin Pritchard and Seren, took off. Like me, Seren was a registered Welsh pony. His name meant &#x201c;star,&#x201d; and his palomino coat gleamed like the golden horse atop a trophy. We even had the same great-grandsire, Dyoll Starlight.&nbsp;<br> Seren stood like a rock while Catrin splashed around for an apple, then galloped hard on the homestretch. They finished with a few lengths&#x2019; lead over the other teams.&nbsp;<br> Rhiannon was next. She gave Cadfael a big kick as they bolted across the chalk line in the grass.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Quiet aids!&#x201d; called Rowena, our instructor.&nbsp;<br> She had driven us here early this morning in her green truck and rust-colored trailer. All day she kept her hawk-sharp eye on the team to ensure that everyone was riding safely and showing proper Pony Club spirit. That meant our riders must help out anyone who needed it and not be sore losers or gloating winners. It also meant that we ponies mustn&#x2019;t lay back our ears or make faces at the other teams&#x2019; mounts to intimidate them.&nbsp;<br> Cadfael and Rhiannon set a blazing pace. But Cadfael was overexcited and didn&#x2019;t stop when he reached the buckets. He kept galloping across the meadow. When Rhiannon finally got him turned around, he trampled in circles around the bucket, and I was afraid he&#x2019;d knock it over. That would disqualify our team!&nbsp;<br> But Rhiannon bit into her apple quickest of&nbsp;all. Carmarthenshire still had a small lead by the time Cadfael flashed across the finish line.&nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, the last pair was little Nan Hughes on Arthur.&nbsp;<br> Each race had four laps, and our Pony Club had nine members. It was only fair that even the youngest and newest riders got to have a turn. But to send Arthur out for the anchor lap? It seemed a poor strategy. He was so wide, and seven-year-old Nan&#x2019;s legs were so short, that her kicks only managed to coax him into a reluctant trot.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your stick, Nan, use your stick!&#x201d; hollered Gwen. Nan didn&#x2019;t like to use her riding crop, but it was the only tool with the power to make Arthur canter. Now she lifted her arm and gave the pony a firm swat on the flank. Arthur broke into a reluctant canter.&nbsp;<br> Nan had trouble biting into the slippery, wet apples, but eventually she got one. We ponies stamped and whinnied to Arthur as he lumbered down the homestretch.<br> <i>Look sharp, Arthur, stout lad! </i>nickered Seren.<br> <i>For Pony Club, for glory! </i>called Huw.<br> <i>Churn those hooves, Old Blossom. . . .&nbsp;</i><br> It was only this last cry from Cadfael that urged Arthur into a true gallop. You see, Arthur had a piebald color that, combined with his large girth, made him bear a striking resemblance to a black-and-white milk cow.<br> Cadfael&#x2019;s nickname was the only thing I had known to annoy good-natured Arthur. As a result, he thundered toward the finish line with a speed that would be unremarkable to most onlookers but was astonishing to those who knew him. It&nbsp;was enough. Arthur&#x2019;s spotted nose crossed the finish line a whisker ahead of Eridge Hunt&#x2019;s pony.<br> The riders cheered for Nan. Her round face blushed to the tips of her ears. Arthur arched his neck with pride and looked almost regal.<br> But I was distracted from his moment of glory by the pail of apples near the finish line. The fact that they were bitten and bruised only made them smell sweeter. Gwen didn&#x2019;t notice the reins sliding through her fingers. . . .</p><h2>Cooking With Columbo: Suppers With The Shambling Sleuth: Episode guides and recipes from the kitchen of Peter Falk and many of his Columbo co-stars</h2><p>Grab your rumpled raincoat, chomp down on a cigar, and rattle those pots and pans!&nbsp; It&#x2019;s time to braise, broil, chop, chill, grill, roast, and poach with world&#x2019;s most beloved sleuth!&nbsp; &nbsp; Columbo super-fan, Jenny Hammerton, offers an episode by episode guide to the food and drink so prominently featured throughout the greatest television detective series ever made.

His journey is a coming-of-age saga that takes him from communes to monasteries, from the warm Pacific to the icy New York shore. Equal parts spiritual memoir and surfer's tale, this is a chronicle of finding meditative focus in the barrel of a wave and eternal truth in the great salty blue.</p><p>Jaimal Yogis is an award-winning journalist and photographer who spends a good deal of his spare time surfing and traveling the globe. He has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in New York City and his work has been published in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>The Toronto Star</i>, <i>Beliefnet</i>, <i>Tricycle</i>, and many more. He lives in San Francisco and is a regular contributor for <i>San Francisco Magazine</i>."Jaimal's story is, in part, an adventure story in which the sea is a powerful antagonist, at once the siren and the ogre, irresistible and terrifying in its sheer, monstrous power. For this author, it's a voracious and demanding lover, and he is skilled at summoning its ever-changing presence." Source: The Huffington Post<br><br>"A journalist, photographer, and surfer, Yogis began the life of a roving seeker his junior year of high school, when he ran away from his Sacramento, Calif. home to learn how to surf in Hawaii. His subsequent travels include a handful of prime surfing spots, but Yogis's more arresting journey is spiritual, taking him to monasteries in France and Berkley, Calif., and deep into the living tradition of Zen Buddhism. Captured here in short chapters and wonderful, visual prose, Yogis's coming-of-age odyssey also takes readers into the culture of indigenous Hawaiians, who believe the gods were surfers. Yogis's long-time surfing mentor Rom provides insight into the science of surfing, ocean swells, the bathymetry of the continental shelf, deep water canyons and sea mounts. Even land lovers will find Yogis's lessons resonant and entertaining, but surfers will find this a quick, surprisingly deep tribute to the quest for surf and serenity."

This time around, the detectives are joined by Olivia Benchet, a reluctant psychic who hails from a highly dysfunctional family. Olivia's visions of a priestly killer who tortures and sacrifices young females provide Bentz and Montoya with their best clues, but Olivia may be the next victim if Bentz doesn't shrug off his cynicism concerning visions and romantic entanglements with the wild-haired psychic. Twice burned by his former wife, who had an affair with his half-brother, Bentz now lives for work and his rebellious, 19-year-old daughter, Kristi. The hunt for the murderer escalates when Olivia realizes her visions are a two-way mirror, and the killer has Kristi and Olivia in his sights. Jackson's sanctimonious serial killer, who refers to himself as The Chosen One, is stock, but the dynamics between her protagonists, particularly between Bentz and Olivia, are a welcome counterpoint to the violent action. Although some readers may be repulsed by the killer's sexually sadistic crimes, which are depicted in graphic detail,others will be intrigued by Jackson's portrayal of the grotesqueries that result when faith and family are perverted. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arkansas Hiking Trails: A Guide to 78 Selected Trails in &#34;The Natural State&#34;</h2><p>This popular guidebook is the most complete resource available on Arkansas hiking trails.

At least that's what everyone says and how they are constantly depicted. But what, exactly, does this strength entail? And what price do Black women pay for it? In this book, the author, a psychologist and pastoral theologian, examines the burdensome yoke that the ideology of the Strong Black Woman places upon African American women. She demonstrates how the three core features of the ideology emotional strength, caregiving, and independence constrain the lives of African American women and predispose them to physical and emotional health problems, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and anxiety. She traces the historical, social, and theological influences that resulted in the evolution and maintenance of the Strong Black Woman, including the Christian church, R &amp; B and hip-hop artists, and popular television and film. Drawing upon womanist pastoral theology and twelve-step philosophy, she calls upon pastoral caregivers to aid in the healing of African American women's identities and crafts a twelve-step program for Strong Black Women in recovery.</p><p>Chanequa Walker-Barnes is Assistant Professor of Pastoral Care and Counseling at McAfee School of Theology, Mercer University, Atlanta, Georgia. She is a licensed psychologist and a candidate for ordination in the United Methodist Church. Her articles have been published in a wide range of scholarly journals, including Journal of Pastoral Theology, Child Development, and American Journal of Community Psychology.''Too Heavy a Yoke is a much-needed, thoughtful, and nuanced examination of the 'Strong Black Woman' stereotype--a significant new contribution to multiple disciplines of pastoral care and counseling, psychology, sociology, African American and womanist-feminist studies, and constructive theology. Walker Barnes draws on both womanist and Trinitarian theologies to examine how the church can play a part in healing and liberating black women from 'the burden of strength.' Meticulously researched and beautifully written, this book belongs on the shelf of every minister and pastoral counselor, and indeed every woman who knows in her soul the burdens of being a 'StrongBlackWoman.'''<br>--Pamela Cooper-White, Ben G. and Nancye Clapp Gautier Professor of Pastoral Theology, Care, and Counseling, Columbia Theological Seminary<br><br>''Well done! This book is a much-needed gift to the field of pastoral theology. It is a well nuanced and explicated research volume and a practical guide for caregivers, pastors, those who love women struggling with the ideology of the 'StrongBlackWoman,' as well as those in recovery.''<br>--Marsha Foster Boyd, President Emerita, Ecumenical Theological Seminary<br><br>''A prayerful, prophetic, poetic, pastoral, powerful womanist analysis of the StrongBlackWoman, from an interdisciplinary, experiential perspective names the context, content, complexities, and pathology of many Black women's embodied archetypal, systemic oppression and posits hopeful options for a paradigmatic shift of recovery. Woven with artistry and passion, Too Heavy a Yoke is a must-read for clergy, therapists, caregivers, and any persons or groups committed to the liberation of black women, ultimately the liberation of all society.''<br>--Cheryl A.

G. K. Beale, coeditor of the award-winning <i>Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament</i>, examines how the New Testament storyline relates to and develops the Old Testament storyline. Beale argues that every major concept of the New Testament is a development of a concept from the Old and is to be understood as a facet of the inauguration of the latter-day new creation and kingdom. Offering extensive interaction between the two testaments, this volume helps readers see the unifying conceptual threads of the Old Testament and how those threads are woven together in Christ. This major work will be valued by students of the New Testament and pastors alike.</p><p>"Beale's volume is far reaching, written at a high scholarly level, and conversant with a wide range of scholarship. Even where one may disagree, Beale's treatment is always informative and at times even provocative. A very important contribution to biblical theology that deserves to be widely read."<br>--<b>Andreas J. K�stenberger</b>, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"Biblical scholars and theologians, after long separation and now perhaps with a healthier sense of their own historical location, have recently found themselves engaged on a common project: what is it that binds the church's canonical texts together? Reflecting its author's situatedness within the evangelical Reformed tradition and firm commitment to exegetical integrity and the priority of the biblical storyline, Beale's extensive and detailed new book is a most welcome addition to the ongoing discussion."<br>--<b>Rikk Watts</b>, Regent College<br> <br>"In your hands is a gold mine of biblical scholarship, a distillation of a lifetime of study by one of the most respected New Testament scholars of our day. Beale's arguments and conclusions are presented with such clarity and force that any interested reader, whether pastor, layperson, or professional scholar, will be able to benefit from the rich insights that appear on almost every page."<br>--<b>Gordon P. Hugenberger</b>, Park Street Church, Boston; Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br>"Beale has been harvesting the fields of biblical theology in major biblical commentaries and exegetical/theological studies for many years. Here now is his biblical theology magnum opus. As with all of Beale's works, this volume is brimming with rich and deeply satisfying redemptive-historical exegesis. This provides an enormous feast for anyone wishing to understand in greater detail the thrust of the Bible's saving story, but it also results in a great contribution to scholarship."<br>--<b>Charles E. Hill</b>, Reformed Theological Seminary Orlando<br><br>"This volume, impressive for its massive sweep, is the matured fruit of the author's extensive work over several decades in New Testament theology. Especially those with interests in biblical eschatology, with some attention to the role of the church and Christian living 'between the times,' as well as in the New Testament use of the Old will profit from the characteristically sound and often stimulating instruction Beale provides."<br>--<b>Richard B. Gaffin Jr.</b>, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia<br><br>"<i>A New Testament Biblical Theology</i> takes Beale's years of study, teaching, and research and presents his readers with the most thorough and mature work of New Testament biblical theology yet seen in the English language. He has structured the massive volume in a beautiful fashion, focusing nearly half of the work on the eschatological storyline of the Old Testament then moving to the story of the already-not yet latter-day resurrection and new-creational kingdom of the New."<br>--<b>Richard C. Gamble</b>, Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary"The canonical scope and focus on the biblical storyline give Beale's <i>New Testament Biblical Theology</i> a unique place among the many New Testament theologies now available. The book is vintage Beale, creatively making connections between Old Testament and New Testament and pursuing a definite vision of how the Bible hangs together."<br>--<b>Douglas J. Moo</b>, Wheaton College<br><br>"Certainly Beale has written his magnum opus, in which he deftly integrates the Scriptures via the new creation theme. The use of the Old Testament in the New Testament forms the backbone of this work so that readers grasp how the storyline of Scripture coheres. We stand in debt to the author for his detailed and profound unfolding of New Testament theology."<br>--<b>Thomas R. Schreiner</b>, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"A magnificent achievement! Rarely does a volume in biblical studies come along with such breadth, depth, insight, and specificity. It is a brilliant reconstruction of themes that are central to Christian faith. This is a landmark accomplishment."<br>--<b>David F. Wells</b>, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br>"Reflecting thirty years of research, this volume is unique in our time and in fact without close parallel in a discipline (biblical theology) that split the Old Testament off from the New over two hundred years ago. Beale has brought them back together in a creative and methodical way."<br>--<b>Robert W. Yarbrough</b>, Covenant Theological Seminary<br><br>"Drawing on decades of exegetical research and teaching, <i>A New Testament Biblical Theology</i> exists at the intersection of biblical studies and theology. Carrying on the tradition of Geerhardus Vos, Beale has raised the bar for biblical theology in our day. We will be digesting this volume for many years to come."<br>--<b>Michael Horton</b>, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>"A stimulating read. Readers will find the emphasis on the already-not yet end-time new creation and kingdom very enriching and insightful. What we have in this new biblical theology is an appreciation for the biblical story as a whole, an appreciation that provides a much-needed counterweight to the atomistic tendencies in much of our exegetical and theological work. Beale's book will make an important contribution."<br>--<b>Craig A. Evans</b>, Acadia Divinity College<br><br>"Beale demonstrates new creation as an umbrella category covering all of the other major motifs not only in the New Testament but also in the relevant Old Testament and Second Temple Jewish background material. Along the way, readers are treated to outstanding up-to-date discussions of most of the main topics they have come to expect and some new ones. Throughout, Beale is thoroughly evangelical and thoroughly scholarly. This work is a true tour de force."<br>--<b>Craig L. Blomberg</b>, Denver Seminary</p><h2>The Art of Happy Moving: How to Declutter, Pack, and Start Over While Maintaining Your Sanity and Finding Happiness</h2><p><p><strong>A comprehensive, upbeat guide to help you survive the moving process from start to finish, filled with fresh strategies and checklists for timing and supplies, choosing which items to toss and which to keep, determining the best place to live, saying farewell and looking forward to hello.</strong><br><br>Moving is a major life change&#x2014;time consuming, expensive, often overwhelming, and sometimes scary.

Constructed as a single, 20-foot-long, accordion-folded panel, this time line begins with a chart illustrating the lifelines of early Genesis characters from Adam to Abraham, then follows the biblical story beginning with Abraham circa 2166 B.C.E. The work is comprised of two parallel portions: The upper part follows biblical and Christian history, while the bottom covers a wide-ranging and representative set of dates and events for corresponding world history from both the East and West. &nbsp; Thankfully, the authors give fairly equal attention to Christianity's many expressions: Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestant forms, etc. Graphics and symbols highlight especially important points and significant people, who are denoted by red squares, and the illustrations add interest and visual appeal without cluttering the time line. But while it invites close study and concentrated browsing, the book can become cumbersome. The amount of data is almost overwhelming- one page alone examines Wilberforce to Darwin and the Opium Wars to influenza, with dozens of persons and events in between. An index would have been helpful. Nonetheless, the authors offer a feast of information for the church-history buff. Without commentary or agenda, the book stands as an objective resource for personal or group study.&#x201d;<br><br>Review&nbsp;by:&nbsp; Ed&nbsp;Hindson,&nbsp;host of The King is Coming TV Broadcast - January 11, 2007 &#x201c;Spectacular!

A Guide to the Teachings and Practices of the Catholic Church, by Kevin Orlin Johnson, Ph.D., describes the various traditions and customs inherent in the Catholic faith. One section of the book that I found very interesting was the significance of numbers. Many numbers have very obvious significance, for instance seven means a complete series, whether it is the seven sacraments or the seven deadly sins. The symbolic explanation that I found most intriguing was that of the number five. The author asserts that the number is actually quite "naughty," because it is through out five senses that we find temptation.

The author indicates with his fabled clarity and directness the precise nature of the modern deviation, and devotes special attention to the development of modern philosophy and science, and to the part played by them, with their accompanying notions of progress and evolution, in the formation of the industrial and democratic society which we now regard as &#39;normal&#39;. Gu�non sees history as a descent from Form (or Quality) toward Matter (or Quantity); but after the Reign of Quantity-modern materialism and the &#39;rise of the masses&#39;-Gu�non predicts a reign of &#39;inverted quality&#39; just before the end of the age: the triumph of the &#39;counter-initiation&#39;, the kingdom of Antichrist. This text is considered the magnum opus among Gu�non&#39;s texts of civilizational criticism, as is Symbols of Sacred Science among his studies on symbols and cosmology, and Man and His Becoming according to the Vedanta among his more purely metaphysical works.</p><p>"The works of Ren� Gu�non (1886-1951), all but unknown to the English-reading public, are nevertheless regarded by many significant thinkers as among this century's most powerful and effective remedies for the anti-traditional spirit and virulent relativism of modernism. As for `post-modernism', we confess ignorance of its exact meaning (if it has one), but do know that, without the rigor of metaphysical principles as reconstituted for the West especially by Gu�non, it will soon decay into yet another academic specialty. <p>Titus Burckhardt, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Marco Pallis, S.H. Nasr, Martin Lings, Huston Smith, William Chittick, and Joseph Epes Brown are among the better known writers who have been inspired by Gu�non; less well-known, or influenced less directly, are Philip Sherrard, Gai Eaton, Whitall Perry, William Stoddart, E.F. Schumacher, Mircea Eliade, Elemire Zolla, Julius �vola, and Jacob Needleman. Without doubt, however, the best-known and most profound author whose works stand in direct relation to Gu�non's is Frithjof Schuon, whose many books, spanning more than half a century, are considered by many to represent the most complete exposition of the `transcendent unity' of religions--both from a doctrinal and methodological point of view--ever presented. </p><p>Gu�non's many works have remained uninterruptedly in print in French since their initial publication, but the case has been quite otherwise in English: only a few have been translated, and these few have never been in print for long, and been very scarce on the used-book market. No doubt this can be explained in part by the nature of Gu�non's writing, for he places extraordinary demands on his readers, and makes no concession to popularism. And yet, at no time has such a critique of civilization and exposition of traditional metaphysical principles as he provides been more necessary than now. Gu�non's works are an indispensable corrective that will be recognized--`on impact' one might almost say--by those who have begun to recognize the pernicious influences at large in the contemporary world, but who lack the formation to draw all the necessary conclusions unaided. In an ecumenic age, Gu�non formulates the only possible reconciliation of the legitimate--but apparently conflicting--demands of external religious forms (exoterism) with the essential core of these forms (esoterism), a reconciliation that has no truck with the sentimental and `politically-correct' ecumenicism that has come to typify our age, offering a table of random traditional dishes to be sampled at one's pleasure, with no spiritual committment, to say the least. </p><p>Sophia Perennis et Universalis has undertaken to make Gu�non's works available again, as well as new translations and works by related authors. Gu�non never doubted that his books would eventually reach those few for whom they were intended, despite the difficulties entailed in publishing them; and this is the position we also adopt, trusting that support will be forthcoming for further editions as more and more readers recognize their significance. We hope that this simple limited edition reprint of The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, one of Gu�non's masterpieces, will be a first step toward a larger-scale publishing program in the future, and take this opportunity to thank Gu�non's heirs and their agent, Mr. Gouverneur, as well as the original French publishers, for their cooperation in making this edition possible. To the many individuals who have supported this effort over the past few years we express our gratitude, and invite you, new reader, to join us as well." --James Wetmore</p>According to its author, The Reign of Quantity is directed to &#34;...the understanding of some of the darkest enigmas of the modern world, enigmas which the world itself denies because it is incapable of perceiving them although it carries them within itself, and because this denial is an indispensable condition for the maintenance of the special mentality whereby it exists.&#34;</p><h2>Money Matters Workbook for Teens (ages 11-14)</h2><p><p><b>"Why learn to manage my money?

We come to God through faith alone. &#x2015;Martin LutherResounding across the centuries, Martin Luther&#x2019;s prolific writings as a pastor, theologian, scholar, Bible translator, father, and more, remain powerful and richly relevant. Faith Alone is a treasury of accessible devotionals taken from Luther&#x2019;s best writings and sermons from the years 1513 through 1546.

Faith Alone will deepen your understanding of Scripture and help you more fully appreciate the mystery of faith.</p><p>James C. Galvin (EdD), is a former national training director of Youth for Christ (USA), and is now an organizational consultant specializing in strategy, leadership, and change. Dedicated to releasing the potential of leaders and organizations, he has been developing resources for Christian leaders for over twenty years. He and his wife and two children live in Winfield, Illinois.Faith Alone Introduction Martin Luther is one of the most important figures in church history because God used him to launch one of the greatest revolutions of all---the Reformation. His writings are nearly five hundred years old yet still meaningful for us to read today. Born in Germany in 1483, Luther studied law at the University of Erfurt. During a violent thunderstorm, he made a dramatic vow to become a monk and soon after entered the Augustinian order. After rigorous academic study and intense, personal struggle to find God&#39;s approval, he rediscovered the gospel. He realized that we are saved by faith alone. After he was ordained, he was sent to the University of Wittenburg to teach theology. While there in 1517, he nailed the Ninety-five Theses on the church door to invite a theological debate. The topics he listed caused such a furor that the debate never took place. As Luther continued to write, preach, and teach, he quickly became the leading figure and focal point of the Reformation. Luther was a professor, theologian, former monk, scholar, author, Bible translator, and defender of the faith. But he was also a pastor, husband, father, and good friend to many. Luther was prolific. Besides writing commentaries, theological papers, and letters to friends, his students and followers took careful notes of his university lectures, sermons, and later in life, even his dinner conversations. He died in 1546 at the age of sixty-three. These selections, originally written by Martin Luther between 1513 and 1546, have all been freshly translated into English for this devotional. The goal was to make this edition both accurate and easy to understand. I selected the readings primarily from Luther&#39;s sermons, commentaries, and other devotional writings. These selections cover topics both theological and practical. Some of the theological themes you&#39;ll find include the centrality of Christ, justification by faith alone, the authority of Scripture, and the importance of putting faith in God above human reason. Practical themes include the struggle against sin and temptation, prayer, humility, the handling of wealth and possessions, the value of everyday work, the importance of marriage and family, and love for neighbor. You may read one selection a day according to the date or explore themes using the subject index located in the back of the book. The verse at the beginning of each reading is usually the one that Luther was writing about or preaching on. At times I&#39;ve attached a different verse that better fits the theme of the devotional thought. If you want to read more on the topic or view the selection in context, you can locate it in English or German using the index to other editions located in the back of the book. Several talented professionals were involved in helping to make this devotional a reality. I wish to thank the three translators who worked diligently to capture the meaning, tone, and imagery of Luther: Ric Gudgeon, Gerhard Meske, and Trudy Krucke Zimmerman. I also wish to thank the English stylists who improved each reading and made Luther speak English: Jonathan Farrar and Kristine A. Luber. In addition, Jonathan Farrar worked closely with me on the final editing and provided encouragement along the way. Martin Luther loved God and wanted people to believe in Christ and grow in faith. He forcefully preached and defended the doctrine that we are justified through faith alone---plus nothing. Faith Alone, then, is a fitting title for a devotional based on Luther&#39;s writings. May this book point you to the Scriptures and help you understand the importance of faith, appreciate the mystery of faith, and encourage you to grow in faith. James C. Galvin, EdD Faith Comes First For we are God&#39;s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. Ephesians 2:10 You have often heard me say that the Christian life has two dimensions: the first is faith, and the second is good works. A believer should live a devout life and always do what is right. But the first dimension of the Christian life---faith---is more essential. The second dimension---good works---is never as valuable as faith. People of the world, however, adore good works. They regard them to be far higher than faith. Good works have always been valued more highly than faith. Of course, it&#39;s true that we should do good works and respect the importance of them. But we should be careful that we don&#39;t elevate good works to such an extent that faith and Christ become secondary. If we esteem them too highly, good works can become the greatest idolatry. This has occurred both inside and outside of Christianity. Some people value good works so much that they overlook faith in Christ. They preach about and praise their own works instead of God&#39;s works. Faith should be first. After faith is preached, then we should teach good works. It is faith---without good works and prior to good works---that takes us to heaven. We come to God through faith alone. We Live by Faith For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: &#39;The righteous will live by faith.&#39; Romans 1:17 When I was a monk, I didn&#39;t accomplish anything through fasting and prayer. This is because neither I nor any of the other monks acknowledged our sin and lack of reverence for God. We didn&#39;t understand original sin, and we didn&#39;t realize that unbelief is also sin. We believed and taught that no matter what people do, they can never be certain of God&#39;s kindness and mercy. As a result, the more I ran after and looked for Christ, the more he eluded me. When I realized that it was only through God&#39;s grace that I would be enlightened and receive eternal life, I worked diligently to understand what Paul said in Romans 1:17---a righteousness from God is revealed in the gospel. I searched for a long time and tried to understand it again and again. But the Latin words for &#39;a righteousness from God&#39; were in my way. God&#39;s righteousness is usually defined as the characteristic by which he is sinless and condemns the sinner. All the teachers except Augustine interpreted God&#39;s righteousness as God&#39;s anger. So every time I read it, I wished that God had never revealed the gospel. Who could love a God who is angry and who judges and condemns us? Finally, with the help of the Holy Spirit, I took a closer look at what the prophet Habakkuk said: &#39;The righteous will live by his faith&#39; (Habakkuk 2:4). From this I concluded that life must come from faith. I therefore took the abstract to the concrete level, as we say in school. I related the concept of righteousness to a person becoming righteous. In other words, a person becomes righteous by faith. That opened the whole Bible---even heaven itself---to me!</p><h2>Insiders Reveal Secret Space Programs &amp; Extraterrestrial Alliances: Volume 1</h2><p>Classified space programs have been an integral part of a complex jigsaw puzzle concerning UFOs, extraterrestrial life, ancient civilizations and advanced aerospace technologies, which have long defied any coherent understanding. Now finally, we have something to put all the pieces together with the disclosures of secret space program whistleblower, Corey Goode. A detailed investigation of Goode&#x2019;s and other insider testimonies reveals the big picture of a parallel world of secret space programs and extraterrestrial alliances. Learn from this book: how the Vril/Nazi flying saucer programs in the 1930&#x2019;s gave birth to the &#x2018;Dark Fleet&#x2019;; how Operation Paperclip scientists both helped and hindered the development of the US Navy&#x2019;s &#x2018;Solar Warden&#x2019;; how the MJ-12 Group was behind the creation of the &#x2018;Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate&#x2019;; and how Ronald Reagan was instrumental in the creation of the &#x2018;Global Galactic League of Nations&#x2019; space program. Finally, learn how the Sphere Being Alliance and other extraterrestrials interact with these programs. The full disclosure of secret space programs and extraterrestrial alliances will unshackle the chains of deception holding humanity back from reaching its highest potential as galactic citizens.</p><p>Dr. Michael Salla is an internationally recognized scholar in international politics, conflict resolution and U.S. foreign policy.

In this new title in the <i>Top Trails</i> series, veteran outdoors author Mike White leads day-trippers and backpackers into some of the most awe-inspiring terrain on earth. Step-by-step in his trail-worn boots, the author created a menu of 57 diverse routes, from a gentle half-mile morning loop to a 29-mile backpacking adventure. Winding through Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte counties, he guides readers into this landscape of lush, old-growth redwoods; picture-postcard vistas to Pacific Ocean sea stacks; winding descents to undisturbed beaches and mesmerizing tide-pool life; pathways to inland canyons; and untamed wilderness shy on humans but boisterous with herds of Roosevelt elk. For readers ready to hit the trail, this is the can't-do-without guide and for armchair travelers, it's 57 journeys into wonderland.<br></p><p><b>Mike White</b> grew up in Portland, OR, where his adventures in the Cascade Range spawned his interest in the outdoors. He became a full-time writer, eventually writing or contributing to numerous outdoor guides. A featured speaker for outdoors and conservation organizations, he lives in Reno, NV.Following are 2 kinds of excerpts:<br>Area Overviews for all 7 chapters of the bookOne complete hiking entry (from Chapter 1)<br><b>CHAPTER 1: Mendocino County (12 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>Famous for a picturesque coastline of high bluffs, rocky sea stacks, tidepools, and strips of sandy beach, Mendocino County also is home to a lesser-known inland forest with isolated pockets of old growth redwoods, rugged stream canyons, and a few waterfalls. Most of these features are protected within a number of state parks or reserves, providing the public with straightforward access to some of the area's best scenery.<br> California Highway 1, also known as the Shoreline Highway, provides the principal access to these lands, with many of the state parks located directly adjacent to this scenic highway. Inland trails in Hendy Woods (Trail 1), Montgomery Woods (Trail 2), and Jackson State Demonstration Forest (Trails 7 &amp; 11) are the exceptions, accessible via state and county roads.<br> Situated a good distance away from major population centers, visitors to Mendocino County are rarely just passing through. Fortunately, several of the state parks have campgrounds and the resort communities strung out along Highway 1 offer numerous lodging options, spanning the range from private campgrounds to high-end bed-and-breakfasts.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 2: Kings Range National Conservation Area and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park (3 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>The rugged and steep topography of the Lost Coast has few equals. Rising 4,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean to the apex of the King Range in a little over four miles is relief uncommon to the world's shorelines. The mountains are so steep here that highway engineers were forced to abandon the coastline route of the Shoreline Highway north of Rockport in favor of directing the road inland to a junction with Highway 101. Nowadays the wild-looking landscape is contained within the Kings Range Conservation Area and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park. However, during the logging heyday, mills, railroads, ports, and settlements littered the area. Fortunately, nature has done a fabulous job of returning the land to a pristine state. Today hikers, backpackers, and equestrians can travel routes through a untamed and highly picturesque wilderness, usually with little or no company, which creates perhaps the premier coastal hiking area in the nation.<br> Not only is the incomparable scenery a prime attribute of the Lost Coast, but also the opportunity to see such a diverse and prolific assortment of wildlife ranks just as high. Stretches of pristine beach are complemented by sightings of a wide variety of marine mammals, including harbor seals, sea lions, and migrating whales. Low tides provide plenty of opportunities for tidepooling. And the skies are commonly filled with an assortment of birds, with the occasional osprey or eagle making an appearance. Inland trails offer the occasional stunning coastline vista, as well as the potential sighting of Roosevelt elk or black bear.<br> Unlike the majority of the North Coast's hiking trails, the Lost Coast is a backpacker's paradise, with the Lost Coast Trail the main highlight. Remote, rugged, and lonely, the path is arguably the quintessential coast-backpacking trip.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 3: Humboldt Redwoods State Park and Humboldt County (14 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>Humboldt Redwoods State Park harbors the most impressive redwood groves on the planet. If not for the nearby presence of Highway 101 and for the Avenue of the Giants running right through the middle of the park, this redwood haven would be an idyllic spot for admiring the tall trees in a reverential atmosphere. As is, the park is still perhaps the premier place to witness some of the last remaining stands of old-growth redwoods in a cathedral-like setting. Straddling the course of the main and south forks of the Eel River, the adjacent alluvial flats provide the prime growing conditions for creating towering Sequoia sempervirens, some approaching 400 feet tall. Although well inland from the majority of redwood parks with warmer temperatures and drier conditions, summer fog creeps up the river and nourishes the coast redwoods. Because of this pattern, the trees are more impressive in the north end of the park, diminishing in stature as you head farther south.<br> Backpackers and long-distance hikers will be disappointed with the lack of opportunities in Humboldt Redwoods. Although some longer trails exist, they forsake the tall trees to travel through unimpressive second-growth forest, better suited for mountain bikers looking for a fun ride than hikers wishing to experience the majesty of the forest. Day-trippers will find an abundant collection of short trails, most of which require little elevation gain. Therefore, the combination of impressive redwood groves, easy paths, and a closer proximity to major population centers than other redwood parks, makes Humboldt Redwoods an attractive destination for tourists. Hikers looking to enjoy the redwoods in peace and tranquility should gravitate toward lesser-used trails, or visit the park during the off-season.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 4: Redwood National Park &amp; Vicinity (11 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>Redwood is the only national park along the far north coast of California. Set aside in the 1960s, the park protects a section of the Redwood Creek drainage, along with a strip of coastline. Although the national park lacks some of the majesty of the old-growth stands found in the state parks due to its late arrival to the party, Redwood National Park offers more of a wilderness feel. Although Highway 101 runs right through the area, many of the trails are located well away from this thoroughfare, offering a higher dose of tranquility than many of the state park trails. Along with three neighboring state parks, Redwood offers a variety of hikes with stunning coastline vistas, sandy beaches, serene forests, and enchanting streams.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 5: Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park (7 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>Similar to Humboldt Redwoods, Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park is bisected by a major waterway bordered by impressive redwoods and accessed by a scenic highway. The banks of Prairie Creek indeed harbor a lush old growth redwood forest and the Newton B. Drury Parkway provides easy tourist access to these wonders. Unlike its neighbor to the south, Prairie Creek has a better network of trails and a scenic strip of coastline. The centerpiece of the park is Elk Prairie, with picnic areas, campgrounds, and a visitor center, as well as being home to a resident population of Roosevelt elk. Away from Elk Prairie the park rarely feels crowded.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 6: Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park (5 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>Similar to the other redwood parks along the North Coast, the steep topography of Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park provides many picture-postcard scenes. Unlike its neighbors, the park's most impressive redwood groves are not positioned alongside a major waterway but instead grow on the steep hillside above the ocean. Persistent fog along this stretch of coastline nourishes the tall trees, oftentimes adding a touch of ethereal mystery to the region.<br> Most of the prime hiking trails within the narrow park are relatively short and coastal in nature, either starting from Highway 101 and descending to the beach, or traversing the hillsides above the ocean. Consequently, ocean views are abundant.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 7: Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park &amp; Vicinity (5 Hikes)</b><br><b>Area Overview</b><br>Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park is the farthest north redwood park in California, which helps to reduce the number of tourists as compared to some of the parks farther south. Jed Smith is also perhaps the most pristine of the national and state parks and offers some of the best redwood scenery as well. Unfortunately for hikers, trails are rather scarce, especially ones that enter the magnificent redwood backcountry. Most of the area's hiking trails are short and close to highways and roads, with the Boy Scout Trail the lone exception. Additionally, the location of the largest trees, including the Del Norte Titan and the Grove of Titans, is kept secret to minimize environmental degradation.<br><br><b>TRAIL ENTRY EXCERPT From Chapter 1: Mendocino County</b><br><b>Trail 6:</b>Mendocino Headlands State Park: Mendocino Headlands<br><b>Trail Use:</b> Dayhike, Run<br><b>Length:</b> 3.2 miles, 2-4 hours<br><b>Vertical Feet:</b> +200/-200<br><b>Difficulty:</b> Level 1<br><b>Trail Type:</b> Loop<br><b>Features:</b><br>BeachOcean ViewsWildlifeHistoryWildflowers<b>Facilities:</b>RestroomsVisitor CenterResort Town<br>The quaint and picturesque hamlet of Mendocino, featured in the long running TV series <i>Murder She Wrote,</i> starring Angela Lansbury, provides a fine backdrop to the rugged headlands bordering the town on three sides. A 2-mile walk along the edge of the headlands and through town provides a fine contrast between the handiwork of the Creator and the architecture of man. Sheer bluffs offer beautiful vistas of the rocky coastline pounded by the crashing surf and provide excellent vantage points for observing the varied marine life, including migrating whales, dolphins, seals, and a host of sea birds. Walking through town includes the possibility of grabbing a bite to eat or quaffing a libation&#x2014;a most civilized way to hike.<br> The headlands were threatened by a proposed development in the 1960s. Fortunately, the local citizenry banded together and were successful in obtaining historical status for the town and having the headlands declared as open space.<br><b>Best Time</b><br>The trail is open all year. Wildflowers bloom in spring and early summer, providing opportunities for picture-postcard views of the coastline and the quaint village of Mendocino.<br>Directions to Trailhead<br>At a traffic light on Highway 1, turn onto Main Street and head west into the town of Mendocino. In addition to four designated parking lots farther on, the Headlands Trail can be accessed from a couple of points in town, including the historic Ford House Visitor Center (restrooms) at the north end of town, or at the intersection of Main and Hesser streets at the south end. Four blocks north of Main, Hesser intersects Little Lakes Road, where a left-hand turn soon leads onto northbound Hesser Drive. Three parking areas within the next 1/4-mile provide short and easy connections to the headlands trail. Farther along, after Hesser Drive turns east, is the last parking lot, 0.1 mile prior to the intersection of Lansing Street. In addition to picnic tables, this parking lot has restrooms, although they were closed in 2013 due to the budget crisis. The trip description below begins near the Ford House Visitor Center.<br><b>Trail Description</b><br>Securing a parking space on Main Street, which can be difficult on busy weekends when the weather is favorable, enables you to finish the loop in the historic part of town and then grab a post-trip brew or a bite to eat. From the Ford House, 1 a path leads shortly over to the top of the bluff above, from where you have a fine view [ocean views] of Big River entering the ocean. 2 Turn right and follow the path along the bluff south of town through open prairie carpeted with seasonal wildflowers, <b>[wildflowers]</b> eventually coming above Portuguese Beach. Reach a junction with the lateral from the intersection of Main and Hesser streets and then follow the path curving south along the edge of a promontory to the site of the blowhole, encircled by a wood fence. Although you won't likely see any plumes of ocean spray erupting out of the blowhole, the churning ocean waters inside are nonetheless dramatic in their own right. Farther on, a side trail 3 on the left leads down a set of stairs to Portuguese Beach, also known locally as Point Beach. <b>[beach]</b><br>From the Portuguese Beach junction, the main trail continues around the point and eventually heads in a northerly direction. Offshore rocks and islets create a dramatic visual counterpoint to the crashing Pacific waves, as well as providing nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds in spring, including Brandt's cormorants, common Murres, Pigeon Guillemot, and Rhinoceros Auklet. Other birds one might encounter in the area include egrets, loons, ospreys, and oystercatchers. The bluffs are also excellent vantage points for whale watchers in winter and early spring. [wildlife] The largest islet, Goat Island, was once pastureland for a herd of goats. Other signs of civilization can be seen along the route, including iron chains and redwood pilings, visual reminders of the logging heydays. [history] The main path continues a wandering circuit northward along the serpentine course of the bluffs.<br>Eventually the shoreline and the trail curve east, arriving at the final parking area 4 near a grove of cypress trees.

It&#x2019;s one thing to talk about evil and suffering philosophically; it&#x2019;s another to live with it. Philosophy professor Peter van Inwagen wrote,<br><br>Angels may weep because the world is filled with suffering. A human being weeps because his daughter, she and not another, has died of leukemia this very night, or because her village, the only world she knows, is burning and the mutilated bodies of her husband and her son lie at her feet.1<br><br>Three weeks after his thirty-three-year-old son, Christopher, died in a car crash, pastor and evangelist Greg Laurie addressed a crowd of twenty-nine thousand at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve talked about Heaven my whole life,&#x201d; Laurie said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ve given many messages on life after death. I&#x2019;ve counseled many people who have lost a loved one, and I thought I knew a little bit about it. But I have to say that when it happens to you, it&#x2019;s a whole new world.&#x201d; The day his son died, he told the crowd, was &#x201c;the hardest day of my life.&#x201d;2<br><br>When I spoke with Greg ten months later, his faith was strong, but his profound sense of loss remained. Pain is always local. It has a face and a name. And sometimes, for now, it doesn&#x2019;t go away. <br><br><b>The American response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, demonstrated that large-scale evil and suffering usually remain distant from us.<br><br></b>In Sudan, millions, including children, have been murdered, raped, and enslaved.

Since then, they&#x2019;ve been unable to conceive another child. Her lifelong dream of raising children remains unfulfilled.<br><br>I once had to tell a wife, son, and daughter that their husband and father had died on a hunting trip.

Its distribution and degree appear to be entirely random and therefore unfair. Sensitive spirits ask if it can possibly be reconciled with God&#x2019;s justice and love.5<br><br>Richard Swinburne, writing in the <i>Oxford Companion to Philosophy, </i>says the problem of evil is <i>&#x201c;the most powerful objection to traditional theism.&#x201d; </i>6<br><br>Ronald Nash writes, &#x201c;Objections to theism come and go.... But every philosopher I know believes that the most serious challenge to theism was, is, and will continue to be the problem of evil.&#x201d;7<br><br>You will not get far in a conversation with someone who rejects the Christian faith before the problem of evil is raised. Pulled out like the ultimate trump card, it&#x2019;s supposed to silence believers and prove that the all-good and all-powerful God of the Bible doesn&#x2019;t exist.<br><br><b>The problem of evil is atheism&#x2019;s cornerstone.<br></b>German playwright Georg B�chner (1813&#x2014;37) called the problem of evil &#x201c;the rock of atheism.&#x201d; Atheists point to the problem of evil as proof that the God of the Bible doesn&#x2019;t exist. Every day the ancient argument gets raised in college philosophy classes, coffee shops, dinner discussions, e-mail exchanges, blogs, talk<br>shows, and best-selling books.<br><br>Atheists write page after page about evil and suffering. The problem of evil never strays far from their view; it intrudes upon chapters with vastly different subjects. It&#x2019;s one of the central reasons Sam Harris writes, &#x201c;Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply an admission of the obvious.&#x201d;<br>8 Harris then scolds Christians, saying about intelligent people (such as himself ), &#x201c;We stand dumbstruck by <i>you</i>&#x2013;by your denial of tangible reality, by the suffering you create in service to your religious myths, and by your attachment to an imaginary God.&#x201d;9 (At least we know what he&#x2019;s thinking!)<br><br>Many suppose that scientific evidence is the cornerstone of atheism. But the famous one-time champion of atheism, Britain&#x2019;s Anthony Flew, renounced his atheism due to the complexity of the universe and his belief in the overwhelming evidence for intelligent design. After examining Richard Dawkins&#x2019;s reasoning in <i>The God Delusion</i>&#x2013;that the origin of life can be attributed to a &#x201c;lucky chance&#x201d;&#x2013; Flew said, &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the best argument you have, then the game is over.&#x201d; However, although he abandoned his atheism, Flew did not convert to the Christian faith, but to deism. Why? Flew could not get past the problem of evil. He believes that God must have created the universe, then abandoned it.<br><b><br>A faith that leaves us unprepared for suffering is a false faith that<br>deserves to be lost.<br></b><br>A lot of bad theology inevitably surfaces when we face suffering. John Piper writes, &#x201c;Wimpy worldviews make wimpy Christians. And wimpy Christians won&#x2019;t survive the days ahead.&#x201d;10<br><br>Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl wrote, &#x201c;Just as the small fire is extinguished by the storm whereas a large fire is enhanced by it, likewise a weak faith is weakened by predicaments and catastrophes whereas a strong faith is strengthened by them.&#x201d;11 When people lose their faith because of suffering, it&#x2019;s usually a weak or nominal faith<br>that doesn&#x2019;t account for or prepare them for evil and suffering. I believe that any faith not based on the truth needs to be lost. The sooner, the better. <br><br>Believing God exists is not the same as trusting the God who exists. A nominal Christian often discovers in suffering that his faith has been in his church, denomination, or family tradition, but not Christ. As he faces evil and suffering, he may lose his faith. But that&#x2019;s actually a good thing. I have sympathy for people who lose their faith, but any faith lost in suffering wasn&#x2019;t a faith worth keeping. (Genuine faith will be tested; false faith will be lost.)<br><br>If you base your faith on lack of affliction, your faith lives on the brink of extinction and will fall apart because of a frightening diagnosis or a shattering phone call. Token faith will not survive suffering, nor should it.<br><br>Suffering and evil exert a force that either pushes us away from God or pulls us toward him. I know a man who lost his faith after facing terrible evil, suffering, and injustice. My heart breaks for him, and I pray that my family and I will never suffer what he did. But if personal suffering gives sufficient evidence that God doesn&#x2019;t exist, then surely I shouldn&#x2019;t wait until <i>I </i>suffer to conclude he&#x2019;s a myth. If <i>my </i>suffering would one day justify denying God, then I should deny him now in light of <i>other </i>people&#x2019;s suffering.<br><br>The devastation of tragedy feels just as real for people whose faith endures suffering.But because they know that others have suffered and learned to trust God anyway, they can apply that trust to God as they face their own disasters. Because they do not place their hope for health and abundance and secure relationships in this life, but in an eternal life to come, their hope remains firm regardless of what happens.<br><br>Losing your faith may be God&#x2019;s gift to you. Only when you jettison ungrounded and untrue faith can you replace it with valid faith in the true God&#x2013;faith that can pass, and even find strength in, the most formidable of life&#x2019;s tests.<br><br>In her moving book <i>The Year of Magical Thinking, </i>Joan Didion writes about the sudden, unexpected death of her husband.

Obviously not every tragedy leads to winning a national title, but Bethany began where all of us can, by trusting God; in her case, with a support system of people having an eternal perspective. Hence, she was prepared to face suffering when it came, and to emerge stronger.<br><br>Unfortunately, most evangelical churches&#x2013;whether traditional, liturgical, or emergent&#x2013;have failed to teach people to think biblically about the realities of evil and suffering. A pastor&#x2019;s daughter told me, &#x201c;I was never taught the Christian life was going to be difficult. I&#x2019;ve discovered it is, and I wasn&#x2019;t ready.&#x201d;<br><br>A young woman battling cancer wrote me, &#x201c;I was surprised that when it happened, it was hard and it hurt and I was sad and I couldn&#x2019;t find anything good or redeeming about my losses. I never expected that a Christian who had access to God could feel so empty and alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Our failure to teach a biblical theology of suffering leaves Christians unprepared for harsh realities. It also leaves our children vulnerable to history, philosophy, and global studies classes that raise the problems of evil and suffering while denying the Christian worldview. Since the question <i>will </i>be raised, shouldn&#x2019;t Christian parents and churches raise it first and take people to Scripture to see what God says about it?<br><br>Most of us don&#x2019;t give focused thought to evil and suffering until we experience them. This forces us to formulate perspective on the fly, at a time when our thinking is muddled and we&#x2019;re exhausted and consumed by pressing issues. Readers who have &#x201c;been there&#x201d; will attest that it&#x2019;s far better to think through suffering in advance.<br><br>Sometimes sufferers reach out for answers to those woefully unprepared. A physician&#x2019;s assistant friend of ours wrote,<br><br>When I was admitted to the hospital in sepsis with a 50/50 chance of survival, I asked the chaplain how we could believe that God is love, when this felt like the antithesis of love. I said I wouldn&#x2019;t inflict this much suffering<br>on someone I hated, let alone someone I loved. She told me she would &#x201c;look it up,&#x201d; then left my room and never came back. I posed the same question to the social worker who came to visit me a few days later. She<br>told me that God&#x2019;s like a giant and we&#x2019;re like little ants, and sometimes He accidentally steps on our ant hills and some of us get hurt. She said our suffering is random and God&#x2019;s probably not even aware of it.<br><br>Pastor James Montgomery Boice had a clearer perspective. In May 2000, he stood before his Philadelphia church and explained that he&#x2019;d been diagnosed with liver cancer:<br><br>Should you pray for a miracle? Well, you&#x2019;re free to do that, of course. My general impression is that the God who is able to do miracles&#x2013;and He certainly can&#x2013;is also able to keep you from getting the problem in the<br>first place. So although miracles do happen, they&#x2019;re rare by definition....Above all, I would say pray for the glory of God. If you think of God glorifying Himself in history and you say, where in all of history has God most glorified Himself? He did it at the cross of Jesus Christ, and it wasn&#x2019;t by delivering Jesus from the cross, though He could have....God is in charge. When things like this come into our lives, they are not accidental. It&#x2019;s not as if God somehow forgot what was going on, and something bad slipped by.... God is not only the one who is in charge; God is also good. Everything He does is good.... If God does something in your life, would you change it? If you&#x2019;d change it, you&#x2019;d make it worse. It wouldn&#x2019;t be as good.14<br><br>Eight weeks later, having taught his people first how to live and then how to die, Pastor Boice departed this world to &#x201c;be with Christ, which is better by far&#x201d; (Philippians 1:23).<br><br>On the other side of death,...</p><h2>Solution Focused Brief Therapy: 100 Key Points and Techniques</h2><p><p><em>Solution Focused Brief Therapy: 100 Key Points and Techniques</em> provides a concise and jargon-free guide to the thinking and practice of this exciting approach, which enables people to make changes in their lives quickly and effectively.

Were Steve and Insoo still with us, I am sure they would be very happy to see what their &#x201c;students&#x201d; have produced. Solution Focused Brief Therapy: 100 Key Points and Techniques is a clear exposition that embraces and builds on the original SFBT model. It also honors teachers, both de Shazer and Berg, and ultimately their clients, by applying de Shazer&#x2019;s well- known Ockham &#x2019;s razor to explore and describe what is really essential for change to occur. To illustrate the principle: When someone once wrote the words &#x201c;simplify, simplify, simplify&#x201d; to describe SFBT&#x2019;s minimalistic approach, de Shazer famously scratched out two of the words! Along with de Shazer&#x2019;s 1985 Keys and 1988 Clues and Berg&#x2019;s 1994 Family-Based Services, this book ranks at the top.

In these pages, Chrissie gives us her story. We see her all-American 1950s childhood in Ohio, and her teenage self falling for the rock music of the 1960s. We follow her to London, where she takes a job with NME and makes her way into the churning &#x2019;70s London punk scene, meeting Lemmy, Sid Vicious and Iggy Pop, living in squats, writing songs, playing in early versions of the Clash and the Damned. Her work with the Pretenders&#x2014;which melded punk, New Wave, and pop to irresistible effect&#x2014;would catapult her to instant stardom. Through it all is Chrissie&#x2019;s unmistakable voice, ringing with fearless emotional honesty, a razor-sharp wit, and an enduring belief in the power of rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2015:</strong> With her new memoir, Chrissie Hynde makes one point abundantly clear: She, and no one else, could have been Chrissie Hynde. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine how anyone else could so consistently find oneself time and again in the eye of the cultural storm: In just over 300 pages, <em>Reckless</em> charges through her life with, ahem, reckless abandon, taking us from her Northern Ohio upbringing through the demise of the first, combustible incarnation of her iconic band, The Pretenders. Against a tapestry of the urban decay of her hometown of Akron, Hynde walks a fine line between fan and groupie, effortlessly ingratiating herself with the day&#x2019;s rock &amp; roll royalty, including David Bowie, Iggy Pop, and Rod Stewart. As a somewhat shiftless student, she finds herself witness to the tragedy at Kent State University that changed the country and the course of an unpopular war. In London at its punk zenith, Hynde rubs elbows with Johnny Rotten and Joe Strummer while looking for the band that would transform her songs into one of the most stunning debuts in rock history. Permeated with sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll--and sprinkled with sly hints about which experiences became what iconic songs&#x2014;Hynde&#x2019;s tell-all is as audacious, raw, and thrilling as her lyrics.<em>-- Jon Foro</em></p><p>Chrissie Hynde is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, best known as the lead singer and songwriter of the enduring rock band The Pretenders.

In this book, Kenneth Copeland shares the revelation of spiritual laws that govern prosperity. The Laws of Prosperity is written to teach you how to apply these laws in your own life so that you can begin to enjoy the great, abundant life that only God can provide.</p><p>Victory. That word, more than any other, sums up the gospel of Jesus Christ. And preaching that victorious gospel to the world has been Kenneth Copeland&#39;s driving purpose for more than 30 years. An ordained minister, author and internationally recognized preacher, Brother Copeland began his ministry in 1967. Since then, Kenneth Copeland Ministries has grown to include not only its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, but offices in Canada, England, South Africa and Australia as well. Best known for his exuberant proclamation that &#34;Jesus is Lord!&#34;, Kenneth Copeland has introduced people the world over to the saving message of faith. However, the vision of KCM includes more than simply introducing people to Jesus Christ. Theirs is a vision of taking believers on to maturity in the principles of faith, love, healing, prosperity, redemption and righteousness. Every day that vision becomes more of a reality through Kenneth Copeland Ministries daily and weekly television broadcasts, monthly magazine, books, teaching tapes, gospel music recordings, meetings and conventions. Through these KCM outreaches, every day thousands of believers from Jacksonville to Johannesburg are moving from defeat, self-doubt and discouragement - to a life of God-given victory.</p><h2>Matthew&#39;s Dream</h2><p><b>A cleverly told and beautifully illustrated tale of self-discovery from four-time Caldecott Honor winner Leo Lionni.</b><br><br>Matthew the mouse lives in a dreary corner of a dusty attic.

Luckily for us, Plutarch distilled what he learned about wise leadership in a handful of essays, which are filled with essential lessons for experienced and aspiring leaders in any field today. In <i>How to Be a Leader, </i>Jeffrey Beneker presents the most important of these essays in lively new translations accompanied by an enlightening introduction, informative notes, and the original Greek on facing pages.</p><p>In "To an Uneducated Leader," "How to Be a Good Leader," and "Should an Old Man Engage in Politics?" Plutarch explains the characteristics of successful leaders, from being guided by reason and exercising self-control to being free from envy and the love of power, illustrating his points with memorable examples drawn from legendary Greco-Roman lives. He also explains how to train for leadership, persuade and deal with colleagues, manage one's career, and much more.</p><p>Writing at the height of the Roman Empire, Plutarch suggested that people should pursue positions of leadership only if they are motivated by "judgment and reason"&#x2015;not "rashly inspired by the vain pursuit of glory, a sense of rivalry, or a lack of other meaningful activities."

Its Not You - Its Your Programming</h2><p>There are perhaps innumerable books on the market today explaining how a person might become codependent. The problem is, knowing why you may be codependent does nothing to help you recover from being a codependent, which is why I wrote this book. About fifteen years ago, when my life shattered around me I was dumbfounded after being diagnosed with clinical depression and told that my diagnosis was the result of being in a codependent marriage. I was just as shocked to learn that because I was raised by unrecovered adult children of alcoholics, I had essentially been programmed to think in a codependent way. With nowhere else to turn, I decided to learn all I could about adult children of alcoholics, as well as adult children of narcissistic parents in an attempt to help me understand the way my mind processed information and why. What I discovered changed my life, and in fact gave birth to the life I was meant to live. Today I am a passionate self help author and Breakthrough Life Coach who is an expert in the field of codependent recovery. Over the last fifteen years I have collected information based on my professional as well as personal experiences that have allowed me to understand what it takes to heal the codependent mind, and to liberate ones self from the web codependency truly is. &#39;Codependent--Now What?, Its Not Your Its Your Programming&#39; is nothing short of a codependency manifesto. In it you will not only learn deep insights about the true causes of the codependent mindset, but you will also be given the tools you need to heal your childhood programming once and for all. When I was new to codependent recovery, I kept asking myself, &#34;Why can&#39;t I find a book that explains how I can heal from this?&#34; As a Life Coach I have heard countless clients ask me for tools to help them heal. This book is not only what I was asking for so many years ago, but it is what most people are in need of once they too discover that the root of so many of their ongoing troubli</p><p></p><h2>Yoga for the Inflexible Male: A How-To Guide</h2><p><b>A yoga book for the chronically inflexible, with practical, down-to-earth advice for weekend warriors, aging athletes, and anyone else who could benefit from a bit more flexibility in their lives.</b><br><br>The benefits of yoga--greater strength, flexibility, and presence of mind--are for anyone, no matter their skill level. But most classes don't feel that way if you're a first-timer--or an inflexible male. Enter <i>Yoga for the Inflexible Male</i>, a welcoming and humorous guide for people of all stripes that gives three vetted hour-long yoga routines, each with roughly a dozen yoga poses. The poses are illustrated and described in depth, and each one contains variations so that they are accessible to anyone, no matter their flexibility. The back of the book also has sequences geared for practitioners of specific sports, like running, biking, climbing, and so on. As more and more men are encouraged to increase their flexibility, the health advantages of yoga are no longer beyond their reach.</p><p>YOGA MATT is the nom de namaste of Roy Parvin and a nod to the everyman of yoga. Parvin is the award-winning fiction author of <i>In the Snow Forest</i> (WW Norton), and a recipient of a National Endowments for the Arts Grant in Literature. Roy is also an elite cyclist; his devotion to yoga began as therapy for a bout of sleeplessness. The yoga proved to be so therapeutic for his insomnia that he became an evangelist of the ancient practice.A Few Words from Yoga Matt<br><br> A funny thing happened when the new yoga studio, Yoga on Center, came to town. Mainly, that I started doing yoga. You&#x2019;d think somebody named Yoga would be more familiar with the ancient art, but, hey, it&#x2019;s only a family name. I&#x2019;m as inflexible as the rest of us. This is the story of how an inflexible male became a lot more flexible, and it could become your story, too.<br><br> The thought of practicing yoga had dimly crossed my radar. I&#x2019;m athletic, a compulsive bike rider. Yet for all the miles I log in the saddle, I wouldn&#x2019;t call myself limber.&nbsp;I&#x2019;d require an ambulance standing by in order to perform the feat of bending over to touch my toes. The idea of flexibility appealed, but the mental image of practicing yoga in front of women did not. I&#x2019;m sorry: I have my pride. The class I envisioned would be men only. A kind of bring me your stiff, your deeply embarrassed, your previously yoga-phobic.<br><br> Yoga on Center surprisingly agreed. Then something else surprising happened. The class immediately sold out. A second class was added, also selling out. Same story in their other studios. Apparently, there is a fairly large but latent section of the male population interested in the ancient practice&#x2014;if the class was solely for inflexible men.<br><br> Now every Tuesday and Friday at four p.m. a brave contingent of men put on their yoga pants and file into Yoga on Center. Well, to be honest, nobody wears yoga pants in this crowd. Shorts and T-shirts are the rule. It&#x2019;s a room full of men who look like they might be going to the market for a half gallon of milk. Rookies, one and all, blissfully ignorant of the term downward dog, which very well might refer to a depressed canine in need of mood enhancers. Injuries abound. Trick knees, wonky backs, a panoply of sports-related boo-boos. The bodies might not be entirely willing, but the overall spirit is.<br><br> Jerry is our fearless teacher, an athletic seventy-year-old with a bushy mustache and the avuncular bearing of a wrestling coach. A number of years ago, doctors informed him he&#x2019;d need to walk with a cane for the rest of his life. Jerry chose yoga instead. Not only does he walk perfectly well, but he&#x2019;s also capable of bending himself into some insanely freaky positions.<br><br> For our class, Jerry is gentle and encouraging in his instruction. He demonstrates a pose, and the class, to varying degrees of pliancy, imitates his example. Jerry thankfully keeps his corrections to a minimum. The goal isn&#x2019;t to strike the perfect pose, but to embrace the wabi sabi&#x2013;ness of it all. Inhibitions gradually recede.Muscles are stretched and prodded. The rest of the world goes away. We can&#x2019;t pronounce the names of the poses, but we&#x2019;re doing them, and a palpable spirit of <i>hey, look ma, no hands</i> permeates the air. For a bunch of unyielding middle-aged men, it&#x2019;s quite remarkable.<br><br> This book captures that experience, Jerry included. It&#x2019;s not meant to be an encyclopedic tome about yoga. If I can speak on behalf of those with XY chromosomes, we don&#x2019;t care about that stuff. <i>Yoga for the Inflexible Male</i> is intended to give you what you need to improve your flexibility,&nbsp;with plenty of pictures, because as everyone knows, guys like pictures.<br><br> The chapters are divided into three hour-long practices, each comprised of twelve to seventeen poses. One pose transitions into the next. A handy graphic illustrates the good way to do the pose, the not-so-bad, and the ugly&#x2014;the no-frills, basic down-and-dirty. In the back of the book, there&#x2019;s a section for combining poses from different sessions for sport-specific practices.<br><br> <i>Yoga for the Inflexible Male</i> is designed to lie flat for easy reference while you&#x2019;re on the yoga mat. Maybe practice in front of a mirror to ensure you&#x2019;re doing it right. You&#x2019;ll soon discover yoga isn&#x2019;t so different from weight training, except your body&#x2019;s the weight and you&#x2019;re working more on balance, not bulking up. Added bonus: It&#x2019;s also more peaceful than a weight room and requires way less equipment. All you need is this book, a body, a yoga mat, and a willingness to try something new. You&#x2019;ll still be a guy, but with yoga, you&#x2019;ll be a lot less inflexible of body. And perhaps of spirit, too. That&#x2019;s what happened to me.<br><br> One more thing. I&#x2019;m just the microphone here. I&#x2019;ll be the first to admit it: I&#x2019;m no expert. Just a goofy guy who came up with the idea for the class. The rest is all Jerry and he has credentials up the wazoo.<br><br> Don&#x2019;t let that crazy mustache fool you. He brings decades of wisdom to our world of beginner male yoga every week. I&#x2019;ve tape recorded each class. I know, probably illegal in a few states. But it was the only way I could capture every nuance of Jerry&#x2019;s expertise.<br><br> All the jokes&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;are mine. Jerry&#x2019;s funny, but not intentionally. I mean no harm. My aim is to entertain and include everyone. It&#x2019;s not truly funny unless everyone&#x2019;s laughing. Often I&#x2019;m just poking fun at myself, the prototypical inflexible male. The rest is pure joy for yoga. Out of shyness and male bashfulness&nbsp;about looking inept, I thought life was going to pass me by without experiencing the ancient practice. Happily,&nbsp;that didn&#x2019;t happen.<br><br> I&#x2019;m a modest practitioner of the trade, but if I&#x2019;m any indication of what yoga can do, here&#x2019;s the kind of hard data that men appreciate. My average on the bike is a mile per hour faster. Hills and wind are smaller obstacles and I regularly outride cyclists twenty years my junior, laughing to myself as I pass them. It&#x2019;s all natural, none of those performance enhancers. When other riders ask me what my secret is, all I tell them is it&#x2019;s a four-letter word.</p><h2>Ask And It Is Given Cards: A 60-Card Deck plus Dear Friends card</h2><p>These beautiful cards capture the essence of the life-changing, best-selling book Ask and It Is Given.You will experience an enhancing of your personal power, which may, at first, seem illogical or even magical, as the Energy Stream from which these cards have come dovetails with the true essence of your own being.

Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

His suggestion that they should collaborate in order to create an accurate record of Shelby's life and achievements at first was rebuffed but later taken up with enthusiasm. This authorized biography is the result. <i>Carroll Shelby: The Authorized Biography</i> was a long time in the making, as Mills left no stone unturned in his quest to produce the complete study of Shelby's remarkable life. He carried out extensive research and conducted numerous interviews, fully capturing the narrative of Carroll Shelby within and outside of the automotive racing world: his childhood in Texas, wartime tenure with the Army Air Force, and postwar entrepreneurship; his earliest race wins in 1952 and his legendary 1959 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans; his monumental release of the first Cobra and the formation of Shelby American in 1962; his historical partnership with Ford that would last for decades; all the way through to Shelby's personal hobbies, travels, and present-day legacy. Fascinating photographs from Shelby's personal collection complete a book whose original hardcover edition was published mere weeks before his passing, making <i>Carroll Shelby: The Authorized Biography</i> a magnificent and lasting tribute to one of the greatest automotive figures of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p><b>Rinsey Mills</b> has owned AC sports cars, both pre-war and post-war, for forty years. He has restored some and raced others. His books include <i>Original AC Ace and Cobra</i> and <i>Essential AC Cobra</i>.</p>&#x201c;<i>Carroll Shelby: The Authorized Biography</i>&nbsp;by Rinsey Mills has set a tough standard for any future books on Shelby the man because he covers so many areas so thoroughly there&#x2019;s almost nothing else anyone could add &#x2013; no new area to shine light on. We&#x2019;re glad to see that Mills&#x2019; biography got published while Shelby was still there to add to it and to steer the author to sources who could come up with a lot of information that&#x2019;s new. The best part is the price. With a suggested retail price of $35.00 (and lower online), the price represents a real bargain for a book that will take you a whole weekend to read.&#x201d; &#x2013;&nbsp;<i><b>SportsCarMarket.com</b></i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Anyone who reads the book will come away with a far larger appreciation for just how good he was. This was not a guy who dipped his toe into the whole racing thing and built some cars, Carroll Shelby was a world class driver on the level of Moss and Fangio in his era. He was a factory driver for Aston Martin and drove nearly every exotic high end piece of iron made in the 1950s and early 1960s. From Maserati&#x2019;s to Allard&#x2019;s he was there and winning in them. If you want the most academic account of Shelby&#x2019;s racing life that has ever been written and realistically will ever be written, this is the book for you.&#x201d; &#x2013;&nbsp;<i><b>Bangshift.com</b></i><b><br></b>&#x201c;<i>For Carroll Shelby: The Authorized Biography</i>, author Rinsey Mills received full cooperation from Shelby, who sat down with Mills on numerous occasions for interviews. Mills also interviewed family members, friends, and former Shelby American employees/drivers like Chuck Cantwell, Allen Grant, Pete Brock, and Bob Bondurant.&nbsp;Many of the photos are from Carroll Shelby&#x2019;s personal collection and have never been published before.&nbsp;Cobra and Shelby Mustang enthusiasts will be pleased to know that the majority of the 464-page book covers the 1962-1967 time period, from the building of the first Cobra and the formation of Shelby American to the company&#x2019;s third and final win at LeMans. But the book starts with Shelby&#x2019;s birth and childhood in Texas and follows his early success as a race car driver before heart problems forced him to hang up his helmet in 1960. We can&#x2019;t wait to read it.&#x201d; &#x2013;&nbsp;<i><b>MustangMonthly.com</b></i><i><b><br></b></i>&nbsp;"The result is the best, most complete and most reliable of version of the Shelby story, and as someone who has personally written his own error-riddled stories about Shelby (and corrected the error-riddled stories of others), it&#x2019;s a relief to read something about Shelby that isn&#x2019;t overcome with hype. This is a unique and invaluable piece of Carroll Shelby lore." -<b>&nbsp;</b><i><b>Edmunds.com InsideLine&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp;"This is the book that everyone in the Shelby world has been waiting for. Despite the flow of publicity, what was lacking - and has been lacking for 50 years - is the story behind the story. That narrative has been ably provided by Rinsey Mills. He comes to the fore with no shortage of Cobra experience. Other books about Carroll Shelby will certainly be written, but none as thoroughly researched or with so much attention to detail as this one. It is a comprehensive and sometimes confusing story; Mills perseveres and gets it right." -&nbsp;<i><b>Shelby American Automobile Club </b></i><b><br></b><br><br><p>"...the book is worth adding to a personal automotive library" -&nbsp;<b><i>The New York Times</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;This biography is not the usual fluff. Here at last is the real, raw, high octane truth, right from Shelby&#x2019;s first memory as a child through to the present day. Mills has it all in fascinating detail that can be as outrageous as it is funny. It&#x2019;s all there including the whole deeply researched early automotive history in Texas with Jim Hall, Shelby&#x2019;s racing days in Europe and, of course, the legendary Cobra and Ford eras, as well as the years with Toyota and Chrysler and including Carroll&#x2019;s &#x201c;lost&#x201d; years in Africa. It&#x2019;s all etched deeply in the pages of this fantastic 400+ page volume that took Mills several years to research and write.&nbsp;In his almost nine decades Shelby managed to surround himself with incredible talent and wily scoundrels who created as many byzantine problems as stellar triumphs that made Shelby one of the most colorful and controversial characters of our time. I personally recommend this fine book as one of the most interesting and intriguing biographies you&#x2019;ll ever have a chance to read. Having spent several years of my life with Shelby I thought I knew more than most...I wasn&#x2019;t even close. Rinsey has it all.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;-<b>&nbsp;</b><i><b>Peter Brock</b></i></p><br><br><p></p>"Shelby's life and achievements are succinctly summarized in&nbsp;<i>Carroll Shelby: The Authorized Biography</i>.&nbsp;Rinsey Mills, who has written several auto-related books including three about Cobras, the authorized biography leaves no stone unturned.&nbsp;Mills has shone a set of high-intensity driving lights on Shelby's life, and he spent years interviewing not only the man himself, but also his family (including ex-wives), and those most closely connected to his various ventures." -&nbsp;<i><b>Canada.com</b></i><b>&nbsp;</b><b><i><br></i></b>"Carroll Shelby: That Authorized Biography is a nice way to remember the man and the legend.

Most parents want their kids to learn to love God. But most of us struggle to facilitate real spiritual experiences. It&#39;s hard enough to have a meaningful conversation with our kids about spiritual things, let alone help them experience true transformation in the presence of God. Jared Patrick Boyd discovered that children&#39;s spiritual formation is rooted in the imagination. When we lead our children through guided times of imaginative prayer, they can experience a connection with God that transcends mere Bible knowledge or doctrinal content. This unique resource provides six units of weekly guided imaginative prayer, themed around core topics: God&#39;s love, loving others, forgiveness, God as king, the good news of God, and the mission of God. Each unit has six sessions, providing a yearlong experience of spiritual formation for children ages five to thirteen. Through imaginative prayer, you can help your child connect with God. As you do so, you may find yourself connecting more closely with your child, and your own formation as a parent will deepen into greater awareness of God&#39;s work in your lives.</p><p>Jared Patrick Boyd is a pastor (Vineyard USA), spiritual director, and founder of the Order of Sustainable Faith, a missional monastic order for the twenty-first century. He is the author of <em>Invitations Commitments: A Rule of Life.</em> He and his wife have four daughters, and are planting Franklinton Abbey, a new faith community on the west side of Columbus, Ohio."I loved this book! If only it had been around thirty years ago, when our family was exploring devotions! This book is an imaginative game, a devotional guide, and a theology text all rolled into one. It will nurture your own spiritual formation as much as your child's. The guided prayers that form the core of this book are well constructed, creative, and simply delightful. Boyd is not afraid to introduce difficult questions, but he helps me as a parent talk about them with my children. <em>Imaginative Prayer</em> develops essential skills of Christian spiritual formation&#x2015;skills that are often neglected in the training of our children. I would recommend this book to parents, Christian education workers, and theology professors. We all need to imagine the gospel!" (Evan B. Howard, author of Praying the Scriptures, A Guide to Christian Spiritual Formation, and The Brazos Introduction to Christian Spirituality, and coauthor of Discovering Lectio Divina)<br><br>"This is not a book for reading. It's a book for practicing. Jared Boyd graciously invites us to practice new ways of being present to God, ourselves, others, and creation, for and with the younger children (or childlike ones) in our lives. Not surprisingly, we are all transformed in the process. By gently making room and time for creative listening, imagination, and revelation of God's very good news of lavish love, children young and old together come to know God by experiencing this love that surpasses knowledge. From his experience as a parent, a pastor, and a beloved child of God, Jared sets forth practical, prayerful, and playful rhythms to tend the spiritual gardens of our children's lives. These habit-forming, love-shaping practices soften and seed the soil of their Christian imaginations, which the Holy Spirit tends, waters, and grows as he conforms them in love to the image of Jesus. Reminding us not to ask children (or anyone) to go where we are not willing to go ourselves, Jared vulnerably does the same, offering clear, creedal, formative structures with room for the dynamic relationship our children will have with God. Far from instilling knowledge about God into our children, Jared invites us to provide opportunities for our children to encounter and be transformed by God's triune love, faithfully embodying that life together with them as children of our heavenly Father." (Cherith Nordling, associate professor of theology, Northern Seminary)<br><br>"In the age of social media, so many of us struggle to be present to those closest to us and to God, who is an ever-abiding presence with us. Jared Boyd's extraordinary book <em>Imaginative Prayer</em> introduces us to a way of learning to be present to those closest to us&#x2015;our children&#x2015;and together with them to learn to use our imaginations to become more attentive to God's presence with us. Read this book slowly and carefully, and experiment with it: you, your family, and your church will undoubtedly be transformed!" (C. Christopher Smith, founding editor, The Englewood Review of Books, coauthor of Slow Church)<br><br>"As a pastor, I have regularly taught that parents are the most important spiritual influencers in their child's life. But how do we parents do that job well? I would highly recommend <em>Imaginative Prayer</em> to anyone who wants to help their children know and experience God. Jared Boyd engages not only the life of the mind, but also the life of the imagination through each session. His exercises help transform large theological themes like God's love, forgiveness, and the mission of God from the head to the heart, so that parents can be the spiritual influencers we want to be." (Rich Nathan, senior pastor, Vineyard Columbus)<br><br>"In this book of depth and whimsy, Jared Boyd inspires the imagination with new ways of engaging children in the work of the Spirit. I will be using this book for years to come, not only with the ministry leaders I teach, but with my own children! Jared's book speaks to a deep need felt within the church and within the lives of parents to help our children learn new and creative ways to engage with what the Holy Spirit is doing in their lives and in the world today. The result is a book that is practical and reflective: a deep reflection on a way of approaching the inner spiritual life of children." (Beth M. Stovell, assistant professor of Old Testament, Ambrose University, national catalyst, Vineyard Formation (Theological and Spiritual Formation), Vineyard Canada)<br><br>"As a spiritual director, I understand the importance of formational experiences with Jesus rather than knowledge about Jesus. As a mother, I have struggled to find language and resources to transcend my own awkward efforts to help my daughter know right things about God and instead establish a real, lived relationship with God. Jared Boyd's work in <em>Imaginative Prayer</em> is a gift to my mother's heart and, I believe, a gift to the body of Christ as a whole. Our children aren't just the future of the church, they are the church right now. Jared's rooted, Scriptural, and deeply relational guidance is the kind of resource families and congregations simply must pick up if we are to journey together into all that Jesus has for us in this fraught and fractious time. Jared's words are wise, strong, kind, and godly&#x2015;just like Jesus' when he said, 'the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these' (Mt 19:14)." (Tara M. Owens, president and spiritual director, Anam Cara Ministries, instructor, Benedictine Benet Pines Monastery, former senior editor, Conversations Journal)<br><br>"Jared Patrick Boyd invites parents to walk alongside their children into a fuller experience of who God is and his work in us and the world through the beautiful and powerful gift of imagination. These exercises forge a path toward knowing firsthand the love, forgiveness, faithfulness, invitation, good news, and remaking that are ours in Jesus. Be ready for a deep, transformative encounter with the divine, for both your child and yourself. We enthusiastically recommend this book!" (Lisa and Mark Scandrette, authors of Belonging and Becoming and Free)<br><br>"We are shaped not primarily though information-gathering but through practices and experiences that work their way into us, forming our appetites and kindling our imaginations. Many of us want to invite our kids into the miracle of knowing God in prayer and through the Scriptures, but we often aren't sure where to start. <em>Imaginative Prayer</em> is a great gift to parents (or godparents, aunts, uncles, and anyone who loves children) because it offers a guide for us grownups to engage our kids with the gospel holistically&#x2015;not just their minds but also their hearts and imaginations. These prayer exercises are theologically rich yet elegant, even refreshing, in their simplicity. Here is an invitation to wonder, to surprise, to creative engagement with God. Walking through these practices with our kids was delightful and nourishing, not only for our kids but for us parents as well." (Tish Harrison Warren, Anglican priest, author of Liturgy of the Ordinary)<br><br>"As the wise ancients have made clear, prayer is not part of life; it is life. But to pray&#x2015;to live with God in the world as God lives and to be formed in the image of our older brother Jesus&#x2015;necessarily requires the marshaling of our imagination. And it is our imagination that leads to the neuroplastic change&#x2015;flexible alterations in our neuron firing patterns&#x2015;to which St. Paul was referring when speaking of the renewal of our minds. With <em>Imaginative Prayer</em>, Jared Boyd has given us a treasure that reveals not only what children need to flourish in their spiritual formation but, even more, what we adults need&#x2015;we who are woefully undernourished in the practice of truly, robustly imagining God living with us. If the deeper, more joyful, more resilient life is what you seek for your children (and for yourself), then look no further to find what perhaps has been just beyond your imagination but now expectantly awaits your discovery of it." (Curt Thompson, author of The Soul of Shame and Anatomy of the Soul)<br><br>"While imaginative prayer is powerfully transformative for adults, we have to work through our culturally conditioned tendency to equate imagination with fantasy in order to engage in it. But I've often wondered how much more powerful this sort of prayer would be if taught to children before they had learned to distrust their imaginations. <em>Imaginative Prayer</em> is the book I've been waiting for! With clarity, spiritual insight, practical wisdom, and powerful examples, Jared Boyd walks us step by step through the process of helping children experience the love of God in tangible ways that will form their characters for the rest of their lives. Everyone who has the privilege of influencing the spiritual formation of children, from parents to Sunday school teachers, needs to read and utilize this invaluable book!"

These short stories are an excellent introduction to classic literature and legendary historical figures. Children ages 6 to 9</p><p>James Baldwin (1924-1987) burst on the literary scene in 1953 with his novel Go Tell It on the Mountain, which received excellent reviews and immediately was recognized as establishing a profound new voice in American letters. His acclaimed collection of essays, Notes of a Native Son, was published in 1955. A second collection of essays, Nobody Knows My Name, was published in 1961 between his novels Giovanni&#39;s Room (1956) and Another Country (1961).KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES <p>MANY years ago there lived in England a wise and good king whose name was Alfred. No other man ever did so much for his country as he; and people now, all over the world, speak of him as Alfred the Great. </p><p>In those days a king did not have a very easy life. There was war almost all the time, and no one else could lead his army into battle so well as he. And so, between ruling and fighting, he had a busy time of it indeed. </p><p>A fierce, rude people, called the Danes, had come from over the sea, and were fighting the English. There were so many of them, and they were so bold and strong, that for a long time they gained every battle. If they kept on, they would soon be the masters of the whole country. </p><p>At last, after a great battle, the English army was broken up and scattered. Every man had to save himself in the best way he could. King Alfred fled alone, in great haste, through the woods and swamps. </p><p>Late in the day the king came to the hut of a woodcutter. He was very tired and hungry, and he begged the woodcutter s wife to give him something to eat and a place to sleep in her hut. </p><p>The woman was baking some cakes upon the hearth, and she looked with pity upon the poor, ragged fellow who seemed so hungry. She had no thought that he was the king. </p><p>"Yes," she said, "I will give you some supper if you will watch these cakes. I want to go out and milk the cow; and you must see that they do not burn while I am gone." </p><p>King Alfred was very willing to watch the cakes, but he had far greater things to think about. How was he going to get his army together again? And how was he going to drive the fierce Danes out of the land? He forgot his hunger; he forgot the cakes; he forgot that he was in the woodcutter s hut. His mind was busy making plans for to-morrow. </p><p>In a little while the woman came back. The cakes were smoking on the hearth. They were burned to a crisp. Ah, how angry she was! </p><p>"You lazy fellow!" she cried. "See what you have done! You want something to eat, but you do not want to work!" </p><p>I have been told that she even struck the king with a stick; but I can hardly believe that she was so ill-natured. </p><p>The king must have laughed to himself at the thought of being scolded in this way; and he was so hungry that he did not mind the woman s angry words half so much as the loss of the cakes. </p><p>I do not know whether he had anything to eat that night, or whether he had to go to bed without his supper. But it was not many days until he had gathered his men together again, and had beaten the Danes in a great battle.</p></p><h2>Ramona Quimby, Age 8: A Newbery Honor Award Winner</h2><p><p><strong>In this Newbery Honor Book from beloved author Beverly Cleary, eight-year-old Ramona Quimby's zest for life is infectious as ever. </strong></p><p>Ramona likes that she&#x2019;s old enough to be counted on, but must everything depend on her? Mrs. Quimby has gone back to work so that Mr. Quimby can return to school, and Ramona is expected to be good for Mrs. Kemp while her parents are away, to be brave enough to ride the school bus by herself, and to put up with being teased by Danny the Yard Ape. In Ramona&#x2019;s world, being eight isn&#x2019;t easy, but it&#x2019;s never dull!&nbsp;</p></p><p>From the first day of third grade, when Ramona Quimby meets her eventual nemesis Yard Ape, life moves on at its usual wild pace--usual for the boisterous Ramona, that is. Soon she is accidentally squashing a raw egg into her hair at the school cafeteria, being forced to play Uncle Rat with her annoying young neighbor, and, worst of all, throwing up in her classroom. The responsibilities of an 8-year-old are sometimes daunting, especially in a family that is trying to squeak by while the father goes back to school. But Ramona is full of too much vim and vigor to ever be down for long. <p> In her second Newbery Honor Book about Ramona (the first was <i>Ramona and Her Father</i>), Beverly Cleary presents another slice of the Quimby family life. Author of more than two dozen children's books, Cleary has a true knack for understanding the tangle of thoughts and emotions in a child's mind and heart. Empathic, witty, and astute, she has earned many other awards, including the Newbery Medal for <i>Dear Mr. Henshaw</i>. Alan Tiegreen's clever line drawings have charmed countless readers of Cleary's books over the years, and his style is now inextricably tied to hers. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Riding the school bus alone isn't the only new experience making third grade exciting for Ramona Quimby. From befriending a boy called Yard Ape to delivering her book report in the style of a television commercial, Ramona's enthusiasm for life is infectious and irresistible. </p><p>That's not to say all is perfect. Having to go to the Kemps' house after school is Ramona's own particular burden&#x2014;especially the chore of being nice to pesky little Willa Jean. When Ramona gets sick and throws up in class, she feels as though things can't get worse!</p><p>In this Newbery Honor Book, newly illustrated by Jacqueline Rogers, Beverly Cleary lovingly chronicles Ramona's experiences as she faces all of her third-grade challenges with imagination and determination.</p></p><h2>Missing Links</h2><p><i>When a group of middle-class buddies obsessed with golf set up a bet to see who can finagle their way onto the nearby private course, their friendship is tested in ways they had never expected in this humorous novel from Rick Reilly, one of America&#x2019;s most popular sportswriters.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Missing Links</i> is the story of four middle class buddies who live outside of Boston and for years have been 1) utterly obsessed with golf and 2) a regular foursome at Ponkaquoque Municipal Course and Deli, not so fondly known as Ponky, the single worst golf course in America. Just adjacent to these municipal links lies the Mayflower Country Club, the most exclusive private course in all of Boston and a major needle in their collective sides. Frustrated by the Mayflower's finely manicured greens and snooty members, three of Ponky's finest and most courageous&#x2014;Two Down, Dannie, and Stick&#x2014;set up a bet: $1,000.00 apiece, and the first man to somehow finagle his way on to the Mayflower course takes all. Lying, cheating, and forgery are encouraged, to put it mildly, and with the constant heckling and rare aid of Chunkin' Charlie, Hoover, and Bluto--a few more of Ponky's elite--the games begin.<br><br> One of the three will eventually play the Mayflower's course, but their friendships--and everything else--will change as various truths unravel and the old Ponky starts looking like the home they never should have left.</p><p>From <i>Sports Illustrated</i> writer Rick Reilly comes this spoof of all things golf and country club. <i>Missing Links</i> recounts the tale of a coterie of golfing friends who ply their hobby at Ponkoquogue Municipal Golf Links and Deli. An 18-hole garbage dump with hazards that include a concrete river surrounded by a chain-link fence and the pillars of the elevated train that runs through the course, it is reputed to be the worst golf course in America. One day the group inadvertently discovers that all along they've been playing right next door to the Mayflower Club, a true golfing Eden. The rollicking plot includes a bet to see who will be first to sneak in a round at the Mayflower, as well as the narrator's attempts to reach some sort of reasonable understanding with his overbearing father."Don't get started reading this book.

The truth about what happened to Franklin&#x2019;s ill-fated Arctic expedition was shrouded in mystery for more than a century. Then, in 1984, Owen Beattie and his team exhumed two crew members from a burial site in the North for forensic evidence, to shocking results. But the most startling discovery didn&#x2019;t come until 2014, when a team commissioned by the Canadian government uncovered one of the lost ships: Erebus.</p><p><b>Owen Beattie</b> is a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta.

It has been created to fill a need for a low cost, yet comprehensive, translation aid to hieroglyphs that is convenient to use. Its emphasis is on words found in monumental inscriptions, as opposed to words found strictly in papyri. The words it contains are most likely to be encountered on the monuments in Egypt or in museums. It contains a about 4,000 entries. This compares favorably to the 2,500 entries in the vocabulary of Alan Gardiner's "Egyptian Grammar", and the 5,000 plus entries in Raymond Faulkner's "Dictionary of Middle Egyptian". The volume's convenient size makes it ideal for everyday use anywhere one happens to be, a local museum or the monuments in Egypt. It is a "must have" for any serious student, Egyptologist or Egyptophile.

While proceeding directly from the newspaper strip tradition, these Web comics present observational humor that's a little more vulgar, a little more clever, and a little more likely to end up with the reader actually learning something than would have been printed in a nationally syndicated comic strip. The humor, like many classic comics, is based on Andy Rooneyesque shared experiences, such as "10 Reasons to Avoid Talking on the Phone," "How to Use a Semicolon (The Most Feared Punctuation on Earth)," and "How to Track, Hunt, and Kill a Unicorn." These are presented in a text-heavy style supplemented with basic, XKCD-like drawings. While the collection is erratic, some of the best strips&#x2014;many dealing with cats&#x2014;hit the universal funny bone. (Mar.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

A conscientious and resourceful chef who lives by the motto &#x201c;Nose to Tail,&#x201d; Henderson advocates using everything that is possibly edible&nbsp;of&nbsp;fowl, beast, and fish, creating dishes that fuse high sophistication with a strong tradition of rustic thriftiness.</p><p><em>The Complete Nose to Tail </em>presents Henderson&#x2019;s complete culinary oeuvre: recipes that offer a unique and delicious eating experience.

His family had been musicians, or bachs as they were called in Germany, for 200 years. He always wanted to be a bach. </p><p>As he grew, he saw patterns in everything. Patterns he would turn into melodies and song, eventually growing into one of the most important and celebrated musical composers of all time. </p><p>This is the story of Johann Sebastian Bach.</p></p><p><b>Tom Leonard </b>has worked as a freelance illustrator for over twenty years. In the past seven years he has focused his work on children's books, usually with a view toward nature. He now lives in Philadelphia and teaches illustration at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;In this elegantly composed biography, Johann Sebastian shares his dream of one day following in his family's footsteps and becoming a "bach," that is to say, a musician. For the young dreamer, "there was always music." Fascinated by different musical instruments, from the harpsichord and violin to the flute and organ, Johann Sebastian Bach (1685&#x2013;1750) learns to play them all. After the death of his parents, he goes to live with his older brother, who gives him music lessons, setting the boy on his journey to greatness. Bach is shown seeing colorful patterns in the music he eagerly copies for his brother. Ultimately, he becomes a church organist, and he creates a "sound that would be heard forever." Adorned with musical notes and swirls of color, the acrylic paintings inventively portray Bach's world and his love of music, providing a rich and striking canvas for the first-person narrative. In one poignant illustration, the composer sits on the riverbank watching gentle raindrops fall. He envisions arrangements of the seven notes on the musical staff in the ripples on the water's surface. On certain pages, unfortunately, the lines of text incorporated into the artwork are lost in the magnificence of the picture. Back matter includes a suggested listening list to enhance young readers' experience of Bach's music. VERDICT A splendid addition to elementary collections. Music lovers will identify with the young composer as they witness his pursuit of his dream.&#x2014;Linda L.

Dr. Sarah Myhill has spent years studying the relationship between mitochondrial malfunction and one of the most common problems that leads people to the doctor&#x2019;s office: fatigue.</p> <p>In <em>Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Myalgic Encephalitis</em>, Dr. Myhill examines this essential role of our mitochondria in energy production and why it is key to understanding and overcoming Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and the inflammation that often accompanies it: Myalgic Encephalitis (ME). She explains the importance of healthy mitochondria, how we can assess how well they are functioning, what we can do to keep them healthy, and how to restore them to health if problems arise.</p> <p>Since publication of the first edition in 2014, new research and new clinical findings have shed further light on a condition that is debilitating to those who suffer from it, but &#x201c;all in the head&#x201d; to many doctors. The second edition of this groundbreaking book includes new insights and chapters on why CFS/ME is the most poorly treated condition in Western medicine, the role of the gut, allergy and autoimmunity, Lyme disease and other coinfections, reprogramming the immune system, reprogramming the brain, and the roadmap to recovery.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Sarah Myhill qualified in medicine (with Honours) from Middlesex Hospital Medical School in 1981 and has since focused tirelessly on identifying and treating the underlying causes of health problems, especially the &#x201c;diseases of civilisation&#x201d; with which we are beset in the West. She has worked in NHS and private practice and for seventeen years was the Hon Secretary of the British Society for Ecological Medicine (renamed from the British Society for Allergy, Environmental and Nutritional Medicine), a medical society interested in looking at causes of disease and treating through diet, vitamins and minerals, and through avoiding toxic stress. She helps to run and lectures at the Society&#x2019;s training courses and also lectures regularly on organophosphate poisoning, the problems of silicone, and chronic fatigue syndrome. She has made many appearances on TV and radio. Visit her website at www.drmyhill.co.uk.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Sarah Myhill does it again, shedding light on chronic illness and patterns of fatigue and extreme brain fog. I was first introduced to the idea that mitochondrial damage was the basis of all disease in the early &#x2019;90s while battling my own health issues, and later, again, in naturopathic medical school in the mid &#x2019;90s. One of my professors taught me that the first sign of mitochondrial damage was fatigue. In a world where we are chronically overfed and undernourished and riddled with &#x201c;holes in our bucket,&#x201d; as Dr. Myhill points out, our mitochondria are in constant battle against dietary indiscretions, lifestyle imbalance, and toxicants, making it difficult to run our internal motors effectively and efficiently. Dr. Myhill explains how we got here and how we can turn it around, offering hope to thousands.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Nasha Winters, coauthor of <em>The Metabolic Approach to Cancer</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Conventional medicine has failed to bring relief to the many thousands of people suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Myalgic Encephalitis, in part because these conditions have roots in mitochondrial damage that are not well understood. Explaining the role of diet, gut health, inflammation, and much more, Dr. Sarah Myhill offers detailed recommendations so that readers can take control of their own recovery.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Tom Cowan, MD, author of <em>Human Heart, Cosmic Heart</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This is a <em>must</em> read for anyone with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Myalgic Encephalitis! It&#x2019;s not only an excellent resource on these two common health conditions but also a clear example of the failings of the conventional medical establishment and the profit-over-patient paradigm that Big Pharma operates on.</p> <p>&#x201c;Right from the beginning of the book, it becomes immediately clear that conventional medicine is far too ill-equipped or ill-trained to deal with such complex disorders. With many possible causes that can lead to wide-ranging symptoms, CFS/ME is a prime example of the need for personalized healthcare and treating the whole <em>person</em>, not just symptoms. However, with the limitations intrinsic to conventional &#x2018;cookie-cutter&#x2019; healthcare, it&#x2019;s almost always symptoms management.</p> <p>&#x201c;In the age of easy access to information, and with this amazing book being so readily accessible, democratizing their own healthcare is now a reality for CFS/ME patients. With clear guidelines on what tests are useful and why, and various treatment options that can be adjusted for each individual situation, this book may just be the resource that rejuvenates tired bodies around the world.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Lee Know, author of <em>Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Dr. Myhill has written an extraordinary book. She is the number one authority on CFS in the UK. Whereas many doctors dismiss the condition, she explains what it is, what has gone wrong in the body, using appropriate tests that are not done by mainstream medicine, and tells people what they can do about it. Whereas mainstream medicine only uses drugs to deal with a particular symptom, Dr. Myhill explains the reasons &#x2018;Why&#x2019;. In my opinion, you will never cure anything unless you understand and deal with the why.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. P. J. Kingsley, MB BS, MRCS, LRCP, FAAEM, DA, DObst, RCOG</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This book is logical and evidence-based but is still an easy read. Dr. Myhill has made the mitochondrial story clear for the non-expert. It makes essential reading for family members or friends of CFS sufferers.

It is based on years of clinical experience, backed by research; written in a clear, concise way with lots of practical instructions &#x2013; and from what I can see using these methods in my practice: it works!&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Franziska Meuschel, MD, PhD, ND, LFhom</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;If the first edition of this book became a key reference that was readable and upbeat, full of information explaining complex issues of cell biology together with practical tips, three years later, the second edition supersedes it with a wealth of added helpful points in the light of more recent developments in the world of &#x2018;functional&#x2019; and environmental medicine. Many important tests are explained in detail together with their role in a person&#x2019;s recovery plan. The folly of the mainstream approach to ME is exposed and is truly shocking. The style is flowing; the evidence is poignant and the references are meticulously made, yet easy to follow. Dr. Myhill has opened the minds of thousands of ME sufferers, and their carers, as to how to seize control of their health in an era when evidence is mounting that the causes of many chronic conditions can be traced to our life-styles and environment.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Apelles Econs, MRCS, LRCP, Allergist</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Brilliant! This book offers the most complete, logical, practical and optimistic guide for people trying to recover from CFS that I am aware of. If every doctor could also take its contents on board, the management of CFS would be revolutionised.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Charles Forsyth, MB BS, FFHom</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Over the years, working as a General Practitioner, I have recommended Dr. Myhill&#x2019;s work to hundreds of patients. Her approach combines an in-depth understanding of human physiology with years of practical experience, and the use of cutting-edge laboratory testing, to diagnose and treat the root causes of complex chronic diseases. Written with humour and compassion, Dr. Myhill has put together a simple step-by-step guide for patients, to take back control of their own health and start their journey to recovery. I am delighted that I can now recommend this book to every patient.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Jens Rohrbeck, MD, MPhil, GP, Functional Medicine Physician</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This book is a &#x2018;must have&#x2019; for everyone suffering from CFS (and their doctors). It explains all the different aspects of this complex condition, and details ways that each patient can contribute to their own recovery. Dr. Myhill has tirelessly dedicated much of her career to improving the quality of life of CFS patients for whom conventional approaches (antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise) have not been enough. Her commitment, genius and sense of humour come across wonderfully in these pages, encouraging and supporting those with this terrible condition not to give up.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Nicola Hembry, BSc, MB BS, MSB, PGDip</strong></p></p><h2>The Art of Pixar: 25th Anniv.: The Complete Color Scripts and Select Art from 25 Years of Animation (Disney Pixar x Chronicle Books)</h2><p>Over the past 25 years, Pixar's team of artists, writers, and directors have shaped the world of contemporary animation with their feature films and shorts.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ-centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition. <i>Exalting Jesus in Exodus</i> is written by Tony Merida.<br></p><p><b>Tony Merida</b> is lead pastor of Imago Dei Church in Raleigh, North Carolina.

At Star Apple, they bring together ecologically sound landscape design principles and small-scale urban agriculture, working with both ornamental and edible plants to create integrated landscapes. Visit www.StarAppleEdibleGardens.com.&nbsp;</p>Introduction&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Welcome to the beautiful edible garden.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a book about edible garden design. It is also a heartfelt invitation to join us in the practice of gardening. For us, gardening is a way to connect with the land, our community, and, perhaps most importantly, ourselves. It is also an opportunity to create and to be inspired. When you pursue food production and beauty together, you form meaningful spaces that have the power to both ground and uplift.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This book features ideas and projects that we have developed as Star Apple Edible + Fine Gardening, our San Francisco Bay Area&#x2013;based edible landscape design service. Our approach is to redefine the plant palette to utilize edible and ornamental plants throughout your garden in a way that is both beautiful and productive. You can put this information to use in creating a space that includes vegetables, fruits, herbs, flowers, and other ornamental plants. We outline how to start, providing design principles and step-by-step guidance for a range of spaces, from front yards and backyards to smaller areas like decks, porches, and side yards, and even container gardens and window boxes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We recommend that you read the first two chapters thoroughly and then refer back to them as needed as you work through your garden design. If you want to start with designing a garden for the backyard or a narrow side yard instead of the front yard, it&#x2019;s fine to jump between chapters three, four, and five according to your needs. Use chapter six as a reference in planting and maintaining your edible garden throughout the year.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For further inspiration, we&#x2019;ve included photographs and sidebars throughout the book from our book partners, Jill Rizzo, Alethea Harampolis, and David Fenton. Photographers David and Jill capture the simple, intangible beauty of the garden and its harvests. At their floral design business, Studio Choo, Jill and Alethea highlight the beauty of the natural world in unexpected floral designs. Their sidebars include instructions for simple ways to utilize edible and ornamental plants from your garden as creative arrangements in your home.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This book is meant to provide general concepts for designing a garden that incorporates edible plants, so we do not include sowing times or specific vegetable- or fruit-planting guidelines because these differ depending upon the climate zone you live in. Instead, we encourage you to use this book along with a vegetable- and fruit-growing guide that covers those specifics. Where we can, we offer multiple plant choices to fit most climate conditions and garden styles so that you can select plants from our suggestions as well as search for other plants on your own.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once your eyes are open to this new way of thinking about edible plants, you&#x2019;ll start to see the potential for beauty and food production everywhere you look. Most important, have fun and enjoy the transformation that is about to take place in your garden.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014;Stefani and Leslie<br>&nbsp;<br>Principle #1: Balance &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are all searching for it, aren&#x2019;t we? So it&#x2019;s not surprising that our gardens need balance, too. Balance is the first, and most important, design principle that you should keep in mind when designing your garden. When people say a garden has &#x201c;a good flow&#x201d; or &#x201c;a good feel&#x201d; about it, they are talking about the garden&#x2019;s balance. Balance is achieved by the grouping and repetition of like elements within a space.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can give your own garden a balanced look by grouping plants and arranging hardscape materials so that elements of structure, color, texture, and quantity are repeated in a purposeful manner throughout your landscape. An annual-vegetable bed that is incorporated into an overall garden design using these techniques will not look messy or out of place. Instead, there will be a seamless transition between edible and ornamental areas of the garden and a sense that everything belongs exactly where it is.<br><br>Hardscape Materials<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An important element to be balanced is your hardscaping materials, such as the natural stone or wood used for patios, decks, paths, and steps, among other elements. Well-designed landscapes complement a home&#x2019;s architecture. When choosing hardscaping materials to use in your yard, look to your home&#x2019;s exterior and repeat a material used in its construction. You can choose another one or two materials to repeat throughout your garden, but try not to use too many different materials; adding more may result in a jumbled, imbalanced look. For example, if you are using metal edging as a border for your planting beds, you could also use metal trellises or arbors within the planting beds. Similarly, natural quarry stone&#x2013;edged planting beds are wonderful combined with similarly colored decomposed-granite pathways, as both share the same hues and stonelike appearance. If you are building steps in this same garden, repeat the stone again for a cohesive look.<br><br>Height<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hardscaping and plants can be used together to provide a sense of balance through your garden. If you have an impressive tall tree on one side of your garden, it will look best if you place a second, or even a third, vertical element, such as a tall vegetable trellis or patio arbor, in another area of the garden. If all the tall elements are grouped together on one side of the garden, that part of the garden will feel overloaded and heavy. Instead, distribute the points of vertical interest across the landscape; they help keep the eye moving through the garden and establish a sense of balance. Similarly, a solid wall in one part of your garden might be echoed and balanced by a low hedge of dense, evergreen plant material; this helps distribute visual weight throughout the entire area and avoids a feeling of imbalance.<br><br>Color<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Color plays such a big role in the look and feel of a garden that its importance cannot be overlooked. The colors you use should enhance the design and balance of your garden&#x2014;not throw it into chaos. Choose your colors purposefully; you&#x2019;ll be happier with the results if you choose just three or four colors and stick to them. These colors should be repeated throughout the garden to establish a cohesive look.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keep in mind that a plant&#x2019;s color is not limited to its fruit or flower color. The leaf color, also known as foliage, of both ornamental and edible plants can supply color to your garden, too. Actually, more often than not, it is foliage color that makes the bigger visual impact in a garden. The color burgundy, for example, can be found in the foliage of ornamental shrubs, like burgundy loropetalum, Japanese maple, and purple smoke bush, and also in the flowers and fruits of edible plants such as the pomegranate tree, the stems of &#x2018;Ruby Red&#x2019; chard, or the leaf color of &#x2018;Bull&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019; beets. In winter, the bare branches and trunks of the deciduous blueberry and Japanese&nbsp;maple are both tinged with coral and red tones. But don&#x2019;t forget shades of green, especially plants with white-and-green-variegated or chartreuse-colored leaves, which are great for lightening up a shady planting area.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can make almost any color combination work well, as long as you stick to a few colors to establish your theme and use other colors selectively. One combination of colors that&#x2019;s versatile in a garden is a base of yellow, purple, and gray, with dashes of red or orange as accent colors. You can use a mix of edibles and ornamental plants such as &#x2018;Moonshine&#x2019; yarrow, lavender, and pineapple guava to establish your main theme. Then use the fruit and flowers of currants, salvia, red sunflowers, and pomegranate for seasonal red accents. Similarly, white, green, burgundy, and silver make for a beautiful base; choose any additional bright color as an accent.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Used in this way, color helps create a balanced and cohesive look among your planting beds. In an integrated edible, ornamental garden that includes many different elements, color is an especially helpful tool for achieving balance across your landscape.<br><br>Texture and Shape<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Plant leaves can be big or small, lush or fine, fuzzy or glossy, rounded or spiny. Mixing different leaf sizes, shapes, and textures helps add subtle depth and visual interest to a garden. Repeating texture and shape in ornamental and edible plants is also an excellent way to create balance throughout your landscape. A good example is the long, narrow leaves of phormiums and leeks. The grassy fronds of each plant reference and play off each other, and can establish a similar textural feel in two different parts of a garden.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rhubarb, a perennial, adds great texture to any garden. Its large, rounded leaves (which are poisonous and thus not edible; only the leaf stems are edible) not only contrast wonderfully with narrow, spikier grasses, but they also repeat the rounded edges of the foliage of many fruit trees, such as fig&#x2014;but at a lower planting height. Dramatic gunnera or other large-leafed subtropical foliage are ornamental plantings that mimic the shape of the rhubarb leaf and bring in a contrasting texture for visual interest and balance.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In linking ornamental and edible parts of your garden, repeat textures from the landscape in your vegetable beds and in the transitional planting beds that surround them. The broad, fuzzy leaves of &#x2018;Berggarten&#x2019; sage, planted among your edibles, can be mimicked elsewhere in your landscape with ornamental, low-growing lamb&#x2019;s ears.<br><br>Quantity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How you group your edible and ornamental plants is an important design decision. As described above, plantings of a certain height, density, color, or texture in one part of the garden should be paralleled or at least referenced by a similar planting in another part of the garden. If you design a garden bed so that larger numbers of the same plant are grouped with each other, they will have a stronger visual impact than if they are planted separately. This technique is referred to as mass plantings.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grouped together en masse, smaller, less substantial plants can become a real visual presence in the garden and can help establish balance. For example, as long as the planting is massed enough, the grassy texture of small garden chives can be balanced against a much larger ornamental grass placed in another part of the garden. While one red lettuce would go unnoticed, a large clump of them is significant enough to provide visual balance against a larger tree or shrub with burgundy foliage, like a red Japanese maple.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless you are highlighting a special focal-point plant (see page 54) or are planting vegetables in your annual-vegetable planting bed, you should avoid planting a single plant (often referred to by garden designers as a &#x201c;onesie&#x201d;) on its own. Too many single plants placed on their own throughout the garden leads to a choppy look that feels haphazard and unbalanced.</p><h2>Kodokan Judo: The Essential Guide to Judo by Its Founder Jigoro Kano</h2><p>Judo, or the Way of Gentleness, an ideal form of physical exercise and a reliable system. of self-defense, was specially created from traditional Japanese martial arts.

Flights there had been grounded and consequently travel chaos ensued.</p><p>The thought of being stuck in an airport for an indeterminate number of hours&#x2014;days even&#x2014;made me shudder in sympathy for my poor fellow human beings.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t imagine dealing with that on top of the week I&#x2019;d just had. I liked to think I was someone who was usually cool and collected, but lately my emotions were so close to the surface I was almost afraid of them. I asked the universe to forgive me my self-absorption, thankful that I was not someone who wasn&#x2019;t going to make it home today, and continued on my path to the gate desk. There was no one in line, and the man behind it began to smile in welcome as I approached.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, I was wondering&#x2014;Oof!&#x201d; I winced as a laptop bag attached to a big guy whacked against my right shoulder, knocking me back on my heels. The big guy didn&#x2019;t even realize he&#x2019;d hit me as he strode right past me and cut in before me.</p><p>Rude!</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like tae upgrade tae first class, please,&#x201d; he said in a deep, loud, rumbling, very attractive accent that did nothing to soothe my annoyance with him for cutting in front of me.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir,&#x201d; the gate agent answered, in such a flirtatious tone I was sure that if I&#x2019;d been tall enough to see over the big guy&#x2019;s shoulder I would see the agent batting his lashes at him. &#x201c;Okay, flight DL180 to Boston. You&#x2019;re in luck, Mr. Scott. We have one seat left in first class.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, hell no!</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I shoved my way up next to Rude Guy, not even looking at him.</p><p>The gate agent, sensing my tone, immediately narrowed his eyes on me and thinned his lips.</p><p>&#x201c;I was coming here to ask for an upgrade on this flight and he&#x201d;&#x2014;I gestured to my right&#x2014;&#x201c;cut in front of me. You saw him do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss, I&#x2019;m going to ask you to calm down and wait your turn. Although we have a very full flight today, I can put you on our list and if a first-class seat opens up, we will let you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, because the way my week was going, that was likely.</p><p>&#x201c;I was first,&#x201d; I insisted, my skin flushing as my blood had turned so hot with anger at the unfairness. &#x201c;He whacked me with his laptop bag pushing past me to cut in line.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can we just ignore this tiny, angry person and upgrade me now?&#x201d; the deep, accented voice said somewhere above my head to my right.</p><p>His condescension finally drew my gaze to him.</p><p>And everything suddenly made sense.</p><p>A modern-day Viking towered over me, my attention drawing his from the gate agent. His eyes were the most beautiful I&#x2019;d ever seen. A piercing ice blue against the rugged tan of his skin, the irises like pale blue glass bright against the sun streaming in through the airport windows. His hair was dark blond, short at the sides and longer on top. And even though he was not my type, I could admit his features were entirely masculine and attractive with his short, dark blond beard. It wasn&#x2019;t so much a beard as a thick growth of stubble. He had a beautiful mouth, a thinner top lip but a full, sensual lower lip that gave him a broody, boyish pout at odds with his ruggedness. Gorgeous as his mouth may be, it was currently curled upward at one corner in displeasure.</p><p>And did I mention he was built?</p><p>The offensive laptop bag was slung over a set of shoulders so broad they would have made a football coach weep with joy. I was guessing he was just a little over six feet, but his build made him look taller. I was only five foot three but I was wearing four-inch stilettos, and yet I felt like Tinkerbell next to this guy.</p><p>Tattoos I didn&#x2019;t take the time to study peeked out from under the rolled-up sleeve of his henley shirt. A shirt that showed off the kind of muscle a guy didn&#x2019;t achieve without copious visits to the gym.</p><p>A fine male specimen, indeed.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and shot the agent a knowing, annoyed look. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; It was clear to me motorcycle-gang-member-Viking-dude was getting preferential treatment here.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss, please don&#x2019;t make me call security.&#x201d;</p><p>My lips parted in shock. &#x201c;Melodramatic much?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You.&#x201d; The belligerent rumble in the Viking&#x2019;s voice made me bristle.</p><p>I looked up at him.</p><p>He sneered. &#x201c;Take a walk, wee yin.&#x201d;</p><p>Being deliberately obtuse, I retorted, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand Scandinavian.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Scottish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do I care?&#x201d;</p><p>He muttered something unintelligible and turned to the agent. &#x201c;We done?&#x201d;</p><p>The guy gave him a flirty smile and handed him his ticket and passport. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re upgraded, Mr. Scott.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait, what&#x2014;?&#x201d; But the Viking had already taken back his passport and ticket and was striding away.</p><p>His long legs covered more ground than mine, but I was motivated and I could run in my stilettos. So I did. With my carry-on bumping along on its wheels behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a second!&#x201d; I grabbed the man&#x2019;s arm and he swung around so fast I tottered.</p><p>Quickly, I regained balance and shrugged my suit jacket back into place as I grimaced. &#x201c;You should do the right thing here and give me that seat.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know why I was being so persistent. Maybe because I&#x2019;d always been frustrated when I saw someone else endure an injustice. Or maybe I was just sick of being pushed around this week.</p><p>His expression was incredulous. &#x201c;Are you kidding me with this?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t even try not to take offense. Everything about this guy offended me.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x201d;&#x2014;I gestured to him, saying the word slowly so his tiny brain could compute&#x2014;&#x201c;Stole. My. Seat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x201d;&#x2014;he pointed down at me&#x2014;&#x201c;Are. A. Nutjob.&#x201d;</p><p>Appalled, I gasped. &#x201c;One, that is not true. I am hangry. There is a difference. And two, that word is completely politically incorrect.&#x201d;</p><p>He stared off into the distance above my head for a moment, seeming to gather himself. Or maybe just his patience. I think it was the latter because when he finally looked down at me with those startling eyes, he sighed. &#x201c;Look, you would be almost funny if it weren&#x2019;t for the fact that you&#x2019;re completely unbalanced. And I&#x2019;m not in the mood after having tae fly from Glasgow tae London and London tae Phoenix and Phoenix tae Boston instead of London tae Boston because my PA is a useless prat who clearly hasn&#x2019;t heard of international direct flights. So do us both a favor before I say or do something I&#x2019;ll regret&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and walk. Away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t regret calling me a nutjob?&#x201d;</p><p>His answer was to walk away.</p><p>I slumped in defeat, watching him stride off with the first-class ticket that should have been mine.</p><p>Deciding food and coffee could wait until I&#x2019;d freshened up in the restroom&#x2014;and by freshen up I meant pull myself together&#x2014;I wandered off to find the closest one. Staring out of the airport window at Camelback Mountain, I wished to be as far from Phoenix as possible as quickly as possible. That was really the root of my frustration, and a little mortification began to set in as I made my way into the ladies&#x2019; restroom. I&#x2019;d just taken my emotional turmoil out on a Scottish stranger. Sure, the guy was terminally rude, but I&#x2019;d turned it into a &#x201c;situation.&#x201d; Normally I would have responded by calmly asking the agent when the next flight to Boston was and if there was a first-class seat available on that flight.</p><p>But I was just so desperate to go home.</p><p>After using the facilities, I washed up and stared long and hard into the mirror. I longed to splash cold water on my face, but that would mean ruining the makeup I&#x2019;d painstakingly applied that morning.</p><p>Checking myself over, I teased my fingers through the waves I&#x2019;d put in my long blond hair with my straightening iron. Once I was happy with it, I turned my perusal on my outfit. The red suit was one of the nicest I owned. A double-breasted peplum jacket and a matching knee-length pencil skirt. Since the jacket looked best closed, I was only wearing a light, silk ivory camisole underneath it. I didn&#x2019;t even know why I&#x2019;d packed the suit, but I&#x2019;d been wearing black for the last few days and the red felt like an act of defiance. Or a cry for help. Or maybe more likely an act of denial.</p><p>Although I had a well-paid job within an exclusive interior design company as one of their designers, it was expensive to live in Boston. The diamond tennis bracelet on my wrist was a gift on my eighteenth birthday from an ex-boyfriend. For a while I&#x2019;d stopped wearing it, but exuding an image of success to my absurdly wealthy and successful clients was important, so when I started my job I&#x2019;d dug the bracelet out of storage, had it cleaned up, and it had sat on my wrist ever since.</p><p>Lately, just looking at it cut me to the quick.</p><p>Flinching, I tore my gaze from where it winked in the light on my wrist, to my right wrist, where my Gucci watch sat. It was a bonus from my boss, Stella, after my first year on the job.</p><p>As for the black suede Jimmy Choos on my feet, with their sexy stiletto and cute ankle strap, they were one of many I was in credit card debt over. If I lived anywhere but Boston, I would have been able to afford as many Choos as I wanted on my six-figure salary. But my salary went into my hefty monthly rent bill.</p><p>It was a cute, six-hundred-square-foot apartment, but it was in Beacon Hill. Mount Vernon Street to be exact, a mere few minutes&#x2019; walk from Boston Common. It also cost me just over four thousand dollars a month in rent. That didn&#x2019;t include the rest of my bills. I had enough to put some savings away after the tax man took his cut too, but I couldn&#x2019;t afford to indulge in the Choos I wanted.</p><p>So, yes, I&#x2019;d reached the age of thirty with some credit card debt to my name.</p><p>But I guessed that made me like most of my fellow countrymen and -women, right? I stared at my immaculate reflection, ignoring the voice in my head that said some of those folks had credit card debt because of medical bills, or because they needed to feed their kids that week.</p><p>Not so they could live in a ridiculously overpriced area of Boston (no matter how much I loved it there) or wear designer shoes so their clients felt like they were dealing with someone who understood their wants better.</p><p>I bypassed the thought, not needing to mentally berate myself any more than I had since arriving back in Phoenix. I was perfectly happy with my life before I came home.</p><p>Perfectly happy with my perfect apartment, and my perfect hair, and my perfect shoes!</p><p>Perfect was good.</p><p>I straightened my jacket and grabbed hold of the handle of my carry-on.</p><p>Perfect was control.</p><p>Staring at the pretty picture I made in the mirror, I felt myself relax. If that gate agent had been into women, I so would have gotten that first-class seat.</p><p>&#x201c;But forget it,&#x201d; I whispered. It was done.</p><p>I was going to go back out there and get a much-needed delicious Mediterranean-style salad and sandwich from one of my favorite food stops in Phoenix, Olive &amp; Ivy. Feeling better at the thought, I relaxed.</p><p>Once I stopped being hangry, it would all be fine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>2</p><p>Apparently, the universe didn&#x2019;t hate me, because there was a seat free at Olive &amp; Ivy. It was popular, so it didn&#x2019;t surprise me that there was only one stool left at one of the counters around the small restaurant. The young twentysomething woman sitting next to the open chair looked up as I approached, her dark gaze skimming down my body and back up again. A flirtatious welcome smile lit up her face. Huh. I had hoped her obvious interest meant she would hold the seat for me while I ordered food. I rounded her, feeling her follow the movement. I was just about to ask her to keep the seat for me when the thump of a laptop bag on top of the counter at the open seat caused me to flinch.</p><p>&#x201c;This seat is taken.&#x201d;</p><p>I squeezed my eyes closed at the familiar voice.</p><p>No way.</p><p>Nuh-uh!</p><p>No!</p><p>I whirled around and stared up at the source of irritation that had recently entered my life. &#x201c;Yes, it is. By me!&#x201d;</p><p>The Scot&#x2019;s stare was calm, stolidly so, annoyingly so. &#x201c;Have you bought food yet? Because I have. As a paying customer, I think I take precedence over a tiny, entitled fruitcake with a stick up her arse.&#x201d;</p><p>I glowered up at the ceiling aka The Universe. &#x201c;This is not happening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye, &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;re not a fruitcake, talking tae yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>My glare transferred to him. &#x201c;Again with the totally un-PC language.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Babe, look at me.&#x201d; He curled his lip. &#x201c;I am un-PC.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t &#x2018;babe&#x2019; me. That is incredibly overfamiliar of you.&#x201d;</p><p>He bent his head toward me, those icy blue eyes momentarily freezing me to the spot. &#x201c;And I am not having another altercation with you in public. Now bloody shoo.&#x201d;</p><p>He just shooed me?</p><p>Shooed me!</p><p>The Scot pulled the stool out forcefully, so I had to move back or be clobbered by it. He assessed my surprised expression and his countenance, to my confusion, transformed from merely irritated to total disdain. &#x201c;I realize you&#x2019;re probably used tae men falling at your feet, so I&#x2019;ll let you have your two seconds of shocked horror. But if you&#x2019;re not gone in five seconds, I&#x2019;m going tae embarrass the shit out of you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You curse a lot,&#x201d; was the only thing I could think to say under the onslaught of such distaste for me.</p><p>His face clouded over. &#x201c;Five. Four. Three&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I made a sound of disgust, cutting him off, and was about to walk away when the twentysomething woman next to us placed a hand on my arm to stop me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just finishing up, if you&#x2019;d like my seat.&#x201d;</p><p>I gave her a sweet smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so kind, but&#x201d;&#x2014;my voice grew louder&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather sew my eyes shut with cocktail sticks than sit next to an ill-educated dickhole who defies the rumor that Scottish people are the nicest people in the world.&#x201d; I finished it with a triumphant spin that made my hair flip dramatically, and I would have continued to feel like the &#x201c;las...</p></p><h2>Master of Mindfulness: How to Be Your Own Superhero in Times of Stress</h2><p><p><b>Faster than a speeding spitball, more powerful than a playground bully, able to breeze through homework and finish nightly chores in a single bound, it&#x2019;s <i>Master of Mindfulness</i>&#x2014;here to conquer stress, worry, and any trouble that comes your way!</b></p><p>Do you ever feel angry, disappointed, or stressed out about family problems, school, bullies, or trouble with friends?

She believes that mindfulness in schools is the tool most likely to help achieve social justice. In 2007, as part of Park Day School&#x2019;s Community Outreach Program, she and two colleagues launched a pilot program of mindfulness in an Oakland, CA, elementary school that was covered in <i>The New York Times</i> and on NBC. Grossman is also cofounder of Mindful Schools, now one of the largest mindfulness-in-education programs in the world.

His class was comprised of twenty-six wonderful, lively, and smart fifth graders who love mindfulness. Reach Academy is a transitional K&#x2013;5 school where the vast majority of students are on free and reduced lunch, and 99 percent of the students are children of color.

Outsiders jerked their chins, looked at us, shook their heads. We heard things."<br><br>In this profoundly moving novel, Fae Myenne Ng takes readers into the hidden heart of San Francisco's Chinatown, to the world of one family's honor, their secrets, and the lost bones of a "paper father." Two generations of the Leong family live in an uneasy tension as they try to fathom the source of a brave young girl's sorrow.<br><br>Oldest daughter Leila tells the story: of her sister Ona, who has ended her young, conflicted life by jumping from the roof of a Chinatown housing project; of her mother Mah, a seamstress in a garment shop run by a "Chinese Elvis"; of Leon, her father, a merchant seaman who ships out frequently; and the family's youngest, Nina, who has escaped to New York by working as a flight attendant. With Ona and Nina gone, it is up to Leila to lay the bones of the family's collective guilt to rest, and find some way to hope again.<br><br>Fae Myenne Ng's luminous debut explores what it means to be a stranger in one's own family, a foreigner in one's own neighborhood--and whether it's possible to love a place that may never feel quite like home.</p><p><strong>Fae Myenne Ng</strong> was born in San Francisco, and lives in Northern California and New York City. Her short stories have appeared in <em>Harper's</em> and other magazines, and have been widely anthologized.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>We were a family of three girls. By Chinese standards, that wasn't lucky. In Chinatown, everyone knew our story. Outsiders jerked their chins, looked at us, shook their heads. We heard things. </p><p>"A failed family. That Dulcie Fu. And you know which one: bald Leon. Nothing but daughters." </p><p>Leon told us not to care about what people said. "People talking. People jealous." He waved a hand in the air. "Five sons don't make one good daughter." </p><p>I'm Leila, the oldest, Mah's first, from before Leon. Ona came next and then Nina. First, Middle, and End Girl. Our order of birth marked us and came to tell more than our given names. </p><p>Here's another bone for the gossipmongers. On vacation recently, visiting Nina in New York, I got married. I didn't marry on a whim--don't worry, I didn't do a green-card number. Mason Louie was no stranger. We'd been together four, five years, and it was time. </p><p>Leon was the first person I wanted to tell, so I went looking for him in Chinatown. He's not my real father, but he's the one who's been there for me. Like he always told me, it's time that makes a family, not just blood. </p><p>Mah and Leon are still married, but after Ona jumped off the Nam, Leon moved out. It was a bad time. Too much happened on Salmon Alley. We don't talk about it. Even the sewing ladies leave it alone. Anyway, it works out better that Mah and Leon don't live in the same place. When they're not feuding about the past, Leon visits Mah, helps her with the Baby Store, so they see enough of each other. </p><p>Leon's got a room at that old-man hotel on Clay Street, the San Fran. There's a toilet and bath on each floor and the lobby's used as a common room. No kitchen. I gave Leon a hot plate but he likes to have his meals either down the block at Uncle's Cafe or over at the Universal Cafe. </p><p>Leon's got the same room he had when he was a bachelor going out to sea every forty days. Our Grandpa Leong lived his last days at the San Fran, so it's an important place for us. In this country, the San Fran is our family's oldest place, our beginning place, our new China. The way I see it, Leon's life's kind of made a circle. </p><p>In the mornings, Leon likes to sit in the lobby timing the No-55 Sacramento buses, he likes to hassle the drivers if they're not on time. They humor him, call him Big Boss. It was just after eight when I got to the San Fran, but the lobby was empty. There was a thin comb of morning light on the dusty rose-colored sofa, and the straight-back chairs were still pushed up against the wall, at their tidy night angles. When I pulled the accordion doors of the elevator back, they unfolded into a diamond pattern with a loud clang. I yanked the lever back and held it there until the number 8 floated by on the wheel contraption Leon called the odometer; then I jerked the handle forward and the elevator stopped level to the ninth floor. Leon's room was at the end of the corridor, next to the fire escape. </p><p>"Leon?" I knocked. "Leon!" I jiggled the doorknob and it turned. Leon forgets the simplest things--like locking the door: another reason it's better he doesn't live with Mah. </p><p>Without Leon, the room looked dingier. There was an old-man smell, and junk all over. Leon was a junk inventor. Very weird stuff. An electric sink. Cookie-tin clocks. Clock lamps. An intercom hooked up to a. cash register hooked up to the alarm system. When they lived together, Mah put up with it all: his screws, his odd beginnings of projects scattered all over her kitchen table, on their bedside. But the day after he shipped out on a voyage, she threw everything into the garbage. She called it his <i>lop sop.</i> But that didn't stop Leon, who continued inventing on the long voyages. On the ships, his bunk was his only space, so every invention was compact. Leon made a miniature of everything: fan, radio, rice cooker. And he brought them all home.</p><p>Leon was a collector, too. Stacks of takeout containers, a pile of aluminum tins. Plastic bags filled with packs of ketchup and sugar. White cans with red letters, government-issue vegetables: sliced beets, waxy green beans, squash. His nightstand was a red restaurant stool cluttered with towers of Styrofoam cups, stacks of restaurant napkins, and a cup of assorted fast-food straws. Metal hangers dangled from the closet doorknob. On the windowsill were bunches of lotus leaves and coils of dried noodles. There were several tin cans: one held balls of knotted red string, another brimmed with tangles of rubber bands. The third was ashy with incense punks. Beyond these tins, I could see Colt Tower. </p><p>When I visited Leon, he'd make me coffee, boiling water in a pan and straining the grounds like an herbal tea, and then he'd show me every project he had in progress: alarm clocks, radios, lamps, and tape recorders. He'd read to me from his newspaper piles: <i>The Chinese Times, The China Daily News, Wah Kue, World News, Ming Bao.</i> Leon snipped and saved the best stories for his private collection: Lost Husbands, Runaway Wives, Ungrateful Children. </p><p>Leon kept his private stash of money, what he called his Going-Back-to-China fund, in a brown bag tucked into an old blanket of Ona's. I called it his petty-cash bag. I slipped a red envelope inside.</p></p><h2>Enjoy Your Journey: Find the Treasure Hidden in Every Day</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b> <b>Joyce Meyer offers a powerful, concise abridgment of</b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Enjoying Where You Are on the Way to Where You Are Going</i></b><b>.</b><b> </b><br> <br>Are you enjoying every day of your life?

Banished as a pup, he survived and returned as a gnaw wolf--the lowest member of the wolf pack. But Faolan wasn't meant to be a gnaw wolf.

If Faolan can't fulfill his destiny, it could be the end of the wolves of the Beyond.</p><p>Kathryn Lasky is the Newbery Honor-winning author of over 100 books for children and young adults.

He was finding it increasingly difficult to stay awake. His weary eyes turned to the brightest constellation, a rough circle of lights hovering what seemed a handsbreadth above the gaping, broken-eggshell edge of the dome.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> There. That was the Spinning Wheel, wasn&#x2019;t it? It did seem oddly elliptical&#x2014;as though the very sky in which the stars hung had been stretched into an unfamiliar shape&#x2014;but if that wasn&#x2019;t the Spinning Wheel, what else could be so high in the sky in mid-autumn? The Hare? But the Hare had a little nubbly star close beside it&#x2014;the Tail. And the Hare wasn&#x2019;t ever that big, was it?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A claw of wind reached down into the half-ruined building. Gelo� called this hall &#x201c;the Observatory&#x201d;&#x2014;one of her dry jokes, Simon had decided. Only the passing of long centuries had opened the white stone dome to the night skies, so Simon knew it couldn&#x2019;t really have been an observatory. Surely even the mysterious Sithi couldn&#x2019;t watch stars through a ceiling of solid rock.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The wind came again, sharper this time, bearing a flurry of snowflakes. Though it wracked him with shivers, Simon was thankful: the chill scraped some of his drowsiness away. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to fall asleep&#x2014;not this night of all nights.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> So, now I am a man, he thought. Well, almost. Almost a man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon drew back the sleeve of his shirt and looked at his arm. He tried to make the muscles stand up, then frowned at the less than satisfactory results. He ran his fingers through the hair on his forearm, feeling the places where cuts had become ridged scars: here, where a Hun�&#x2019;s blackened nails had left their mark; there, where he had slipped and dashed himself against a stone on Sikkihoq&#x2019;s slope. Was that what being grown meant? Having a lot of scars? He supposed it also meant learning from the wounds, as well&#x2014;but what could he learn from the sort of things that had happened to him during the last year?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t let your friends get killed, he thought sourly. That&#x2019;s one. Don&#x2019;t go out in the world and get chased by monsters and madmen. Don&#x2019;t make enemies.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> So much for the words of wisdom that people were always so eager to share with him. No decisions were ever as easy as they had seemed in Father Dreosan&#x2019;s sermons, where people always got to make a clean choice between Evil&#x2019;s Way and the Aedon&#x2019;s Way. In Simon&#x2019;s recent experience of the world, all the choices seemed between one unpleasant possibility and another, with only the faintest reference to good and evil.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The wind skirling through the Observatory dome grew more shrill. It put Simon&#x2019;s teeth on edge. Despite the beauty of the intricately sculpted pearlescent walls, this was still a place that did not seem to welcome him. The angles were strange, the proportions designed to please an alien sensibility. Like other products of its immortal architects, the Observatory belonged completely to the Sithi; it would never feel quite comfortable to mortals.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Unsettled, Simon got up and began to pace, the faint echo of his footsteps lost in the noise of the wind. One of the interesting things about this large circular hall, he decided, was that it had stone floors, something the Sithi no longer seemed to utilize. He flexed his toes inside his boots as a memory of Jao �-Tinukai&#x2019;i&#x2019;s warm, grassy meadows tugged at him. He had walked barefoot there, and every day had been a summer day. Remembering, Simon curled his arms across his chest for warmth and comfort.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Observatory&#x2019;s floor was made up of exquisitely cut and fitted tiles, but the cylindrical wall seemed to be one piece, perhaps the very stuff of the Stone of Farewell itself. Simon pondered. The other buildings here were also without visible joint or seam. If the Sithi had carved all the buildings on the surface directly from the hill&#x2019;s rocky bones, and had cut down into Sesuad&#x2019;ra as well&#x2014;the Stone seemed shot through with tunnels&#x2014;how did they know when to stop? Hadn&#x2019;t they been afraid that if they made one hole too many the whole rock would collapse in on itself? That seemed almost as amazing as any other Sithi magic he had heard of or seen, and just as unavailable to mortals&#x2014;knowing when to stop.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon yawned. Usires Aedon, but this night was long! He stared at the sky, at the wheeling, smoldering stars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I want to climb up. I want to look at the moon.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon made his way across the smooth stone floor to one of the long staircases that spiraled gradually up around the circumference of the rooms, counting the steps as he went. He had already done this several times during the long night. When he got to the hundredth step, he sat down. The diamond gleam of a certain star, which had been midway along a shallow notch in the decayed dome when he made his last trip, now stood near the notch&#x2019;s edge. Soon it would disappear from sight behind the remaining shell of the dome.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Good. So at least some time had passed. The night was long and the stars were strange, but at least time&#x2019;s journey continued.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He clambered to his feet and continued up, walking the narrow stairway easily despite a certain light-headedness that he had no doubt would be cured by a long sleep. He climbed until he reached the highest landing, a pillar-propped collar of stone that at one time had circled the entire building. It had crumbled long ago, and most of it had fallen; now it extended only a few short ells beyond its joining with the staircase. The top of the high outer wall was just above Simon&#x2019;s head. A few careful paces took him along the landing to a spot where the breach in the dome dipped down to only a short distance above him. He reached up, feeling carefully for good fingerholds, then pulled himself upward. He swung one of his legs over the wall and let it dangle over nothingness.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The moon, wound in a wind-tattered veil of clouds, was nevertheless bright enough to make the pale ruins below gleam like ivory. Simon&#x2019;s perch was a good one. The Observatory was the only building within Sesuad&#x2019;ra&#x2019;s outwall that stood even as high as the wall itself, which gave the settlement the appearance of one vast, low building. Unlike the other abandoned Sithi dwelling places he had seen, no towers had loomed here, no high spires. It was as though the spirit of Sesuad&#x2019;ra&#x2019;s builders had been subdued, or as though they built for some utilitarian reason and not pure pride of craft. Not that the remains were unappealing: the white stone had a peculiar lambent glow all its own, and the buildings inside the curtain wall were laid out in a design of wild but somehow supremely logical geometry. Although it was built on a much smaller scale than what Simon had seen of Da&#x2019;ai Chikiza and Enki-e-Shao&#x2019;saye, the very modesty of its scope and uniformity of its design gave it a simple beauty different from those other, grander places.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> All around the Observatory, as well as around the other major structures like the Leavetaking House and the House of Waters&#x2014;names that Gelo� had given them; Simon did not know if they were anything to do with their original purpose&#x2014;snaked a system of paths and smaller buildings, or their remnants, whose interlocking loops and whorls were as cunningly designed yet naturalistic as the petals of a flower. Much of the area was overgrown by encroaching trees, but even the trees themselves revealed traces of some vestigial order, as the green space in the middle of a fairy-ring would show where the ancestral line of mushrooms had begun.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the center of what obviously had once been a settlement of rare and subtle beauty lay a strange tiled plateau. It was now largely covered with impertinent grass, but even by moonlight it still showed some trace of its original lushly intricate design. Gelo� called this central place the Fire Garden. Simon, comfortably familiar only with the workings of human habitations, would have guessed it to be a marketplace.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beyond the Fire Garden, on the other side of the Leavetaking House, stood a motionless wavefront of pale conical shapes&#x2014;the tents of Josua&#x2019;s company, grown now to a sizable swell by the newcomers who had been trickling in for weeks. There was precious little room left, even on the broad tabletop summit of the Stone of Farewell; many of the most recent arrivals had made themselves homes in the warren of tunnels that ran beneath the hill&#x2019;s stony skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon sat staring at the flicker of the distant campfires until he began to feel lonely. The moon seemed very far away, her face cold and unconcerned.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He did not know how long he had been staring into empty blackness. For a moment he thought he had fallen asleep and was now dreaming, but surely this queer feeling of suspension was something real&#x2014;real and frightening. He struggled, but his limbs were remote and nerveless. Nothing of Simon&#x2019;s body seemed to remain but his two eyes. His thoughts seemed to burn as brightly as the stars he had seen in the sky&#x2014;when there had been a sky, and stars; when there had been something besides this unending blackness. Terror coursed through him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Usires save me, has the Storm King come? Will it be black forever? God, please bring back the light!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> And as if in answer to his prayer, lights began to kindle in the great dark. They were not stars, as they first seemed, but torches&#x2014;tiny pinpoints of light that grew ever so slowly larger, as though approaching from a great distance away. The cloud of firefly glimmers became a stream, the stream became a line, looping and looping in slow spirals. It was a procession, scores of torches climbing uphill the way Simon himself had climbed up Sesuad&#x2019;ra&#x2019;s curving path when he had first come here from Jao �-Tinukai&#x2019;i.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon could now see the cloaked and hooded figures who made up the column, a silent host moving with ritual precision.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m on the Dream Road, he realized suddenly. Amerasu said that I was closer to it than other folk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But what was he watching?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The line of torchbearers reached a level place and spread out in a sparkling fan, so that their lights were carried far out on either side of the hilltop. It was Sesuad&#x2019;ra they had climbed, but a Sesuad&#x2019;ra that even by torchlight was plainly different than the place Simon knew. The ruins that had surrounded him were ruins no longer. Every pillar and wall stood unbroken. Was this the past, the Stone of Farewell as it once had been, or was it some strange future version that would someday be rebuilt&#x2014;perhaps when the Storm King had subjugated all Osten Ard?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The great company surged forward onto a flat place Simon recognized as the Fire Garden. There the cloaked figures set their torches down into niches between the tiles, or placed them atop stone pedestals, so that a garden of fire indeed bloomed there, a field of flickering, rippling light. Fanned by the wind, the flames danced; sparks seemed to outnumber the very stars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Simon found himself suddenly pulled forward with the surging crowd and down toward the Leavetaking House. He plummeted through the glittering night, passing swiftly through the stone walls and into the bright-lit hall as though he were without substance. There was no sound but a continuous rushing in his ears. Seen closely, the images before him seemed to shift and blur along their edges, as though the world had been twisted ever so slightly out of its natural shape. Unsettled, he tried to close his eyes, but found that his dream-self could not shut out these visions: he could only watch, a helpless phantom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many figures stood at the great table. Globes of cold fire had been placed in alcoves on every wall, their blue, fire-orange, and yellow glows casting long shadows across the carved walls. More and deeper shadows were cast by the thing atop the table, a construct of concentric spheres like the great astrolabe Simon had often polished for Doctor Morgenes&#x2014;but instead of brass and oak, this was made entirely from lines of smoldering light, as though someone had painted the fanciful shapes upon the air in liquid fire. The moving figures that surrounded it were hazy, but still Simon knew beyond doubt that they were Sithi. No one could ever mistake those birdlike postures, that silken grace.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> A Sitha-woman in a sky-blue robe leaned toward the table and deftly scribed in trails of finger-flame her own additions to the glowing thing. Her hair was blacker than shadow, blacker even than the night sky above Sesuad&#x2019;ra, a great cloud of darkness about her head and shoulders. For a moment Simon thought she might be a younger Amerasu; but though there was much in this one that was like his memories of First Grandmother, there was also much that was not.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beside her stood a white-bearded man in a billowing crimson robe. Shapes that might have been pale antlers sprouted from his brow, bringing Simon a pang of unease&#x2014;he had seen something like that in other, more unpleasant dreams. The bearded man leaned forward and spoke to her; she turned and added a new swirl of fire to the design.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Simon could not see the dark woman&#x2019;s face clearly, the one who stood across from her was all too plain. That face was hidden behind a mask of silver, the rest of her form beneath ice-white robes. As if in answer to the black-haired woman, the Norn Queen raised her arm and slashed a line of dull fire all the way across the construct, then waved her hand once more to lay a net of delicately smoking scarlet light over the outermost globe. A man stood beside her, calmly watching her every move. He was tall and seemed powerfully built, dressed all in spiky armor of obsidian-black. He was not masked in silver or otherwise, but still Simon could see little of his features.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> What were they doing? Was this the Pact of Parting that Simon had heard of&#x2014;for certainly he was watching both Sithi and Norn gathered together upon Sesuad&#x2019;ra.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The blurred figures began to talk more animatedly. Looping and crisscrossing lines of flame were thrown into the air around the spheres where they hung in nothingness, bright as the afterimage of a hurtling fire-arrow. Their speech seemed to turn to harsh words: many of the shadowy observers, gesticulating with more anger than Simon had seen in the immortals he knew, stepped forward to the table and surrounded the principal foursome, but still he could hear nothing but a dull roaring like wind or rushing water. The flame globes at the center of the dispute flared up, undulating like a wind-licked bonfire.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Simon wished he could move forward somehow to get a better view. Was this the past he was watching? Had it seeped up from the ha...</p></p><h2>Earthsea: The First Four Books</h2><p>One of the classic works of fantasy by renowned writer of the genre Ursula K Le Guin As a young dragonlord Ged whose usename is Sparrowhawk is sent to the island of Roke to learn the true way of magic A natural magician Ged becomes an Archmage and helps the High Priestess Tenar escape from the labyrinth of darkness But as the years pass true magic and ancient ways are forced to submit to the powers of evil and death Including A Wizard of Earthsea The Tombs of Atuan The Farthest Shore Tehanu</p><p>Ursula K.

They were all &#34;scrap quilts&#34; by definition. This book begins with a very interesting preface by Barbara Brackman on the history of scrap quilting. There seemed to have been a lot of argument in the mid 1800s on the value of scrap quilts versus those made from bought fabrics. Some ladies could not defend buying &#34;costly material just to cut up and sew together.&#34; Much better to save calico scraps and beg more from the neighbors. Silk, wool, velvets and calico were all used in scrap quilts. Lissa Alexander&#39;s book gives a wealth of information on choosing colors to make scrappy quilts that can look old or totally fresh. For beginner or intermediate quilters this book is a must. Lissa doesn&#39;t deal with basic quiltmaking techniques, but more with fabric selection and the 12 projects are really delightful. Wall hangings, table runners and full-size quilts are all here with alternative colorways suggested. A great book for any quilter. --Online Quilt Magazine, July 2018</p><h2>Warriors: Warrior&#39;s Return</h2><p><p><strong>A graphic novel adventure from the world of Erin Hunter&#x2019;s #1 nationally bestselling Warriors series! </strong></p><p>In the third book of the Graystripe&#x2019;s Adventure manga arc, follow ThunderClan warrior Graystripe after he is captured by Twolegs in <em>Warriors: The New Prophecy #3: Dawn&#x2014;</em>and completes his difficult journey home.</p><p>Graystripe and Millie have finally found ThunderClan's old territory, but Twoleg monsters have devastated the forest and Graystripe fears that all of his Clanmates have been killed or captured by Twolegs.

He lives in Rochester, New York.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br><b><i>THE POWER OF INCENTIVES<br><br>How Seat Belts Kill</i></b><br><br>Most of economics can be summarized in four words: "People respond to incentives." The rest is commentary.<br><br>"People respond to incentives" sounds innocuous enough, and almost everyone will admit its validity as a general principle. What distinguishes the economist is his insistence on taking the principle seriously at all times.<br><br>I remember the late 1970s and waiting half an hour to buy a tank of gasoline at a federally controlled price. Virtually all economists agreed that if the price were allowed to rise freely, people would buy less gasoline. Many noneconomists believed otherwise. The economists were fight: When price controls were lifted, the lines disappeared.<br><br>The economist's faith in the power of incentives serves him well, and he trusts it as a guide in unfamiliar territory. In 1965, Ralph Nader published <i>Unsafe at Any Speed,</i> a book calling attention to various design elements that made cars more dangerous than necessary. The federal government soon responded with a wide range of automobile safety legislation, mandating the use of seat belts, padded dashboards, collapsible steering columns, dual braking systems, and penetration-resistant windshields.<br><br>Even before the regulations went into effect, any economist could have predicted one of their consequences: The number of auto accidents increased. The reason is that the threat of being killed in an accident is a powerful incentive to drive carefully. But a driver with a seat belt and a padded dashboard faces less of a threat. Because people respond to incentives, drivers are less careful. The result is more accidents.<br><br>The principle I am applying is precisely the same one that predicted the disappearance of gasoline lines. When the price of gasoline is low, people choose to buy more gasoline. When the price of accidents (e.g., the probability of being killed or the expected medical bill) is low, people choose to have more accidents.<br><br>You might object that accidents, unlike gasoline, are not in any sense a "good" that people would ever choose to purchase. But speed and recklessness are goods in the sense that people seem to want them. Choosing to drive faster or more recklessly is tantamount to choosing more accidents, at least in a probabilistic sense.<br><br>An interesting question remains. How big is the effect in question? How many additional accidents were caused by the safety regulations of the 1960s? Here is a striking way to frame the question: The regulations tend to <i>reduce</i> the number of driver deaths by making it easier to survive an accident. At the same time, the regulations tend to <i>increase</i> the number of driver deaths by encouraging reckless behavior Which effect is the greater? Is the net effect of the regulations to decrease or to increase the number of driver deaths?<br><br>This question cannot be answered by pure logic. One must look at actual numbers. In the middle 1970s, Sam Peltzman of the University of Chicago did just that. He found that the two effects were of approximately equal size and therefore cancelled each other out. There were more accidents and fewer driver deaths per accident, but the total number of driver deaths remained essentially unchanged. An interesting side effect appears to have been an increase in the number of pedestrian deaths; pedestrians, after all, gain no benefit from padded dashboards.<br><br>I have discovered that when I tell noneconomists about Peltzman's results, they find it almost impossible to believe that people would drive less carefully simply because their cars are safer Economists, who have learned to respect the principle that people respond to incentives, do not have this problem.<br><br>If you find it hard to believe that people drive less carefully when their cars are safer, consider the proposition that people drive <i>more</i> carefully when their cars are more dangerous. This is, of course, just another way of saying the same thing, but somehow people find it easier to believe. If the seat belts were removed from your car, wouldn't you be more cautious in driving? Carrying this observation to the extreme, Armen Alchian of the University of California at Los Angeles has suggested a way to bring about a major reduction in the accident rate: Require every car to have a spear mounted on the steering wheel, pointing directly at the driver's heart. Alchian confidently predicts that we would see a lot less tailgating.<br><br>It is in no sense foolhardy to take more risks when you have a padded dashboard. Driving recklessly has its costs, but it has its benefits too. You get where you are going faster, and you can often have a lot more fun along the way. "Recklessness" takes many forms: It can mean passing in dangerous situations, but it can also mean letting your mind wander, or temporarily diverting your attention from the road to look for a tape cassette. Any of these activities might make your trip more pleasant, and any of them might be well worth a slight increase in accident risk.<br><br>Occasionally people are tempted to respond that nothing -- or at least none of the things I've listed -- is worth any risk of death. Economists find this objection particularly frustrating, because neither those who raise it nor anybody else actually believes it. All people risk death every day for relatively trivial rewards. Driving to the drugstore to buy a newspaper involves a clear risk that could be avoided by staying home, but people still drive to drugstores. We need not ask whether small pleasures are worth <i>any</i> risk; the answer is obviously yes. The right question is how <i>much</i> risk those small pleasures are worth. It is perfectly rational to say, "I am willing to search for a cassette while driving if it leads to a one-in-a-million chance of death, but not if it leads to a one-in-a-thousand chance of death." That is why more people search for cassettes at 25 miles per hour than at 70.<br><br>Peltzman's observations reveal that driving behavior is remarkably sensitive to changes in the driver's environment. This affords an opportunity for some drivers to influence the behavior of others. Those ubiquitous Baby on Board signs provide an example. The signs are intended to signal other drivers that they should use extraordinary care. I know drivers who find these signs insulting because of the implication that they do not <i>already</i> drive as carefully as possible. Economists will be quite unsympathetic to this feeling, because they know that nobody <i>ever</i> drives as carefully as possible (do you have new brakes installed before each trip to the grocery store?) and because they know that most drivers' watchfulness does vary markedly with their surroundings. Virtually all drivers would be quite unhappy to injure the occupants of another car; many drivers would be especially unhappy if that other car contained a baby. That group <i>will</i> choose to drive more carefully when alerted to a baby's presence and <i>will</i> be glad to have that presence called to theft attention.<br><br>This, incidentally, suggests an interesting research project. Economics suggests that many drivers are more cautious in the presence of a Baby on Board sign. The project is to find out how <i>much</i> more cautious by observing accident rates for cars with and without the signs. Unfortunately, accident rates can be misleading for at least three reasons. First, those parents who post signs are probably unusually cautious; they have fewer accidents just because they themselves are exceptionally careful drivers, independently of how their sign affects others. Second (and introducing a bias in the opposite direction), those parents who post signs know that the sign elicits caution from others, and they can therefore afford to be less vigilant themselves. This would tend to involve them in <i>more</i> accidents and at least partially cancel the effects of other drivers' extra care. Third, if Baby on Board signs really work, there is nothing to Stop childless couples from posting them dishonestly. If drivers are aware of widespread deception, they will tend to suppress their natural responses.<br><br>This means that raw accident statistics cannot reveal how drivers respond to Baby on Board signs. The problem is to find a clever statistical technique to make all the necessary corrections. I do not propose to solve that problem here, but I offer it as an example of a typical difficulty that arises in empirical economic research. Many research projects in economics revolve around creative solutions to just such difficulties.<br><br>After this slight digression into the challenges of empirical research, let me return to my main topic: the power of incentives. It is the economist's second nature to account for that power. Will the invention of a better birth control technique reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies? Not necessarily -- the invention reduces the "price" of sexual intercourse (unwanted pregnancies being a component of that price) and thereby induces people to engage in more of it. The percentage of sexual encounters that lead to pregnancy goes down, the number of sexual encounters goes up, and the number of unwanted pregnancies can go either down or up. Will energy-efficient cars reduce our consumption of gasoline? Not necessarily -- an energy-efficient car reduces the price of driving, and people will choose to drive more. Low-tar cigarettes could lead to a higher incidence of lung cancer. Low-calorie synthetic fats could increase the average weight of Americans.<br><br>Criminal law is a critical area for understanding how people respond to incentives. To what extent do harsh punishments deter criminal activity? A case of particular interest is the death penalty. The deterrent effect of the death penalty has been studied intensely by innumerable government commissions and academic scholars. Often their studies consist of nothing more than examining murder rates in states with and without capital punishment laws. Economists tend to be harshly critical of these studies because they fail to account for other important factors that help to determine murder rates. (Often they fail even to account for how stringently the death penalty is enforced, although this varies appreciably from state to state.) On the other hand, the refined statistical techniques collectively known as <i>econometrics</i> are designed precisely to measure the power of incentives. This makes it natural to apply econometrics in examining the effect of the death penalty. The pioneer in this effort was Prof. Isaac Ehrlich of the University of Buffalo, whose work was published in 1975. His sophisticated analysis led to a striking conclusion: During the 1960s, on average, each execution that took place in America prevented approximately 8 murders.<br><br>The details of Ehrlich's methods have been widely criticized by other economists, but it is possible to make too much of this. Most of the criticisms involve esoteric questions of statistical technique. Such questions are important. But there is widespread agreement in the economics profession that the <i>sort</i> of empirical study that Ehrlich undertook is capable of revealing important truths about the effect of capital punishment.<br><br>In 1983, Prof. Edward Learner of the University of California at Los Angeles published an amusing article called "Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics," in which he warned that the prejudices of the researcher can substantially affect his results. Leamer used the death penalty as an example. He showed that a simple econometric test, with a prodeath penalty bias built in, could demonstrate that each execution prevents as many as 13 murders. The same test, with an antideath penalty bias built in, could demonstrate that each execution actually <i>causes</i> as many as 3 additional murders. Still, unless one goes very far in the direction of building in a bias against the death penalty, most econometric research reveals a substantial deterrent effect of capital punishment. Murderers respond to incentives.<br><br>How can this be? Are not many murders crimes of passion or acts of irrationality? Perhaps so. But there are two responses to this objection. First, Ehrlich's results indicate that each execution prevents 8 murders; it does not indicate <i>which</i> 8 murders are prevented. As long as some murderers can be deterred, capital punishment can be a deterrent. The second response is this: Why should we expect that people engaged in crimes of passion would fail to respond to incentives? We can imagine a man who hates his wife so much that under ordinary circumstances he would do her in if he thought he had a 90% chance of escaping execution. Perhaps in a moment of rage, he becomes so carried away that he will kill her even if he has only a 20% chance of escaping execution. Then even in the moment of rage, it matters very much whether he perceives his chances to be 15% or 25%.<br><br>(Let me mention a third response as well. Ehrlich did not just make up the number 8; he arrived at it through a sophisticated analysis of data. Skepticism is fine, but it is incumbent on the serious skeptic to examine the research with an open mind and to pinpoint what step in the reasoning, if any, he finds suspicious.)<br><br>There <i>is</i> evidence that people respond significantly to incentives even in situations where we do not usually imagine their behavior to be rational. Apparently psychologists have discovered by experiment that when you hand a person an unexpectedly hot cup of coffee, he typically drops the cup if he perceives it to be inexpensive but manages to hang on if he believes the cup is valuable.<br><br>Indeed, the response to incentives may be as innate as any other instinctive behavior. In a series of experiments at Texas A&amp;M University, researchers have allowed rats and pigeons to "purchase" various forms of food and drink by pushing various levers. Each item has its price, such as three lever pushes for a drop of root beer or ten for a piece of cheese. The animals are given "incomes" equal to a certain number of pushes per day; after the income is exhausted the levers become inoperable. In some versions of the experiments the animals are able to earn additional income by performing various tasks. They earn additional lever pushes at a fixed wage rate for each task they perform.<br><br>The researchers have found that rats and pigeons respond appropriately to changes in prices, changes in income, and changes in wage rates. When the price of root beer goes up, they buy less root beer. When wage rates go up, they work harder -- unless their incomes are already very high, in which case they choose to enjoy more leisure. These are precisely the responses that economists expect and observe among human beings.<br><br>Incentives matter. The literature of economics contains tens of thousands of empirical studies verifying this proposition, and not one that convincingly refutes it. Economists are forever testing the proposition (while perhaps secretly hoping to make names for themselves by being the first to overturn it) and forever expanding the domain of its applicability. Whereas we used to think only about shoppers responding to the price of meat, we now think about drivers responding to seat belts, murderers r...</p><h2>You Are Not a Rock: A Step-by-Step Guide to Better Mental Health (for Humans)</h2><p><b>Mental health is . . . being yourself.<br><br>A prescriptive and positive guide, illustrated with line drawings, making the case that mental well-being, like physical health, can be strengthened over time and with specific techniques</b><br><br>We all want to feel less anxiety, guilt, anger and sadness.

It's about some rocks. And it goes like this:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One day, early in the twenty-first century, up on a mountain in the Italian Alps, there were two very large rocks. They sat on the side of a mountain, overlooking a farm on the road between Ronchi and Cortaccia, Strada Provinciale 19 (in case you're planning a road trip).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On that particular day, there were external, contextual factors affecting the rocks, factors over which they had no control. Those contextual factors caused a landslide. And the rocks fell off the mountain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They tumbled down the slope toward the farm. There was a single-lane country road at the bottom of the slope running alongside the farmhouse and the adjoining barn. One of the rocks landed on the road and stopped directly in front of the entrance to the farmhouse. It was a massive rock. It reached up to the roof of the farmhouse. With some extra momentum, it would have destroyed the house and everything (including everybody) inside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other, similarly enormous rock, however, didn't stop at the road. It rolled right across it, into the three-hundred-year-old barn on the other side. The force of the impact destroyed the barn, scattering wall planks and whole sections of the roof across the yard. The rock continued on down into the valley, getting an inefficient head start on the annual wine pressing, coming to rest beside an even larger rock that had fallen off the mountain many years before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If rocks could feel, how do you think that rock would have felt after it did that? Embarrassed? Guilty? Desperate to blame the landslide? Angry at the other rock for not following through on their plan? Do you think that other rock was obsessing about the carnage it would have caused if it hadn't stopped?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How would you have felt if you were either of those rocks? Have you ever spent an hour thinking about what to write in a text message because you were afraid of saying the wrong thing and ruining a relationship? Have you reread and rewritten work e-mails over and over again, anxious about getting fired or seeming incompetent? Does responsibility make you anxious? Do you spend days obsessing about mistakes in your past? Do you wish you could get rid of those memories? Do you hear people in your head shouting at you for screwing up? Do you spend hours trying to rationalize why you're not to blame for things going wrong in your life?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So here's my point: Those are all very human experiences. Those rocks in that valley in Italy will never have any of those experiences. I said "If rocks could feel." They can't, they're rocks. You are not a rock. You feel things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be human</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You probably approach physical fitness like a human. If you want to build strength, you lift heavy things that make you feel weak. If you want to increase endurance, you run until you're sweating and aching and ready to stop, and you keep running a little bit farther so that next time it won't be so difficult. If you want to be more flexible, you stretch into stiffness again and again until your flexibility increases. You try to go beyond last week's limits. You fail and fail and call it practice. You do squats and dead lifts until your legs are wobbly and so sore the next day that you can't sit down on the toilet, and you call that a good workout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This paradoxical practice of doing the difficult thing so that the difficult thing isn't difficult is how humans change. This is a concept most people understand. If you told somebody that you plan to become stronger by avoiding strenuous exercise, even people who don't exercise would know that's ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there are probably many people around you who encourage you to approach mental health in the exact opposite way. They tell you not to do the difficult things. Avoid anxiety, feel less stress, don't think bad thoughts, watch out for triggers, get rid of uncertainty, man up, don't be so emotional, don't feel bad (everything will be okay). This is not how humans develop abilities to handle difficult challenges. Trying to avoid difficult things makes difficult things more difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is so important to understand as you get started on building better emotional fitness. You can develop your ability to handle emotions by feeling more, especially by feeling more of the feelings that challenge you. By lifting heavy emotions, lifting heavy emotions becomes easier. You can feel a greater range of emotions and you can feel them more deeply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poor mental health doesn't fall from the sky. Mental illness is like heart disease-you work your way up to it through a complex mix of environmental, genetic, and educational factors combined with each decision you make at home, at work, at school, and in relationships wherever you might be, every single minute of the day. Turning away from feelings, or trying to control them, cover them up, or chase after them, are the deep-fried pepperoni sticks, triple-decker cheeseburgers, and supersized routines of the mental health world. Sure, you might crave them, and they'll feel good, and you'll never be able to blame a specific junk food for giving you a heart attack, but when they become a regular part of your everyday life, the results are always nasty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the first two chapters, I'll cover two concepts that are fundamental to building better mental health and emotional fitness. It's important that we have a shared idea about what exercises for mental health look like and why we do them. So I'll repeat:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You are not a rock. You feel things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to be a rock</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, I constantly chose to do things inside my head and outside of it not to feel things. I didn't want to feel uncertain, or hated, or alone, or broke, or trapped, or ugly, or hurt, or unhappy, or guilty, or anxious. . . . There were so many feelings I didn't want to feel! I basically wanted to be a rock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rocks don't have varying levels of improvable mental health. Rocks don't imagine stabbing other rocks. Rocks don't get jealous or struggle with their sexuality or question the meaning of existence. Rocks don't convince themselves that other rocks are trying to poison them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we're trying not to feel things, we're trying to be rocks. So it's not surprising that we sink the moment we're thrown into uncertainty. Rocks sink.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rocks will always feel less anxiety than you do. They will beat you every single time at feeling less guilt and regret. No rock will ever make as many mistakes as you will. No matter how much you practice meditation, you will always be more easily distracted and less focused than the most mediocre pebble in a muddy ditch. You will never worry as little as a rock worries. You will never be able to suppress your cravings as well as a rock does. No rock will ever relapse as many times as you do. No rock will ever fail as many times as you fail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you work through the exercises in this book and you live your life, remember that rock in that vineyard in Italy not thinking or feeling about the antique barn it obliterated. You are not like that rock. You cannot be like that rock. You can spend your entire life trying to be like that rock but you'll only make yourself more miserable and you'll probably destroy much more than a barn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You cannot build better mental health by trying to avoid being human. If you want to improve your mental health, it won't happen through wanting to avoid uncertainty, anxiety, and all of the other feelings you don't like. It'll happen by learning how to have those experiences. If you want to avoid human experiences, this is not the book for you. If you continue to pursue escape from those experiences, you will have only more of them, at ever-increasing levels of severity and complexity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is your goal?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We often set goals for ourselves that might be better suited for rocks than for humans. We want to feel less anxiety, less guilt, less sadness; we want to obsess less, engage in compulsions less, be less lonely, less paranoid. . . . But we will never be able to do any of those things as well as rocks do. Have you ever seen a rock addicted to drugs or gambling? I haven't, either. Rocks are so disciplined!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding that I am not a rock frames how I approach every mental health issue in my life. As a human, I can feel and think things I don't like. Translating this understanding into actions has been an incredible support for overcoming mental illness and continuing to improve my mental health. In particular, it shapes the goals I pursue. For you, with your mental health and even with this book, I strongly recommend that you DON'T PURSUE GOALS THAT ROCKS CAN DO BETTER THAN YOU.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding unhappiness is not the same as experiencing happiness. You can pour the rest of your life into trying not to be anxious and trying to prevent your worries from coming true, and all you'll have done is focused your energy on things that didn't even happen and you didn't even want to think about. Use this book to do things that rocks can't do better than you. And to help you with doing that, use the next exercise to set some creative human goals. These will be goals to keep in mind throughout the rest of the book and beyond. Each chapter ahead will help equip you with the knowledge and the skills to achieve these goals. But as you take steps toward your goals, always reflect on this question: Am I trying to do something that a rock can do better than me?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EXERCISE: Creative Human Goals</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rocks can do anything less than you can. But they can't do anything more than you can. So rather than setting goals around what you want to avoid, it helps to set goals around the things you'll build and create. Health is creative, not destructive. That doesn't mean we don't eliminate barriers like compulsive behaviors that get in the way of achieving our goals, but eliminating barriers isn't the end state. Unhealthy behaviors simply become things we don't do anymore because we're spending our time and energy on creating health and happiness and a life that's aligned with our values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So grab something to write with and some paper and articulate creative human goals for yourself that rocks can't do better than you. Here are a couple of ideas to help you with this:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you had one overarching goal for your entire life, what would it be? If you looked at the different areas in your life, like health, relationships, work, education, etc., what would your goal be for each? What would your goal be for today? What's your goal for this moment right now? Take a look at the examples below comparing goals for rocks and goals for humans to see some possible directions for your goals:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GOALS FOR ROCKS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOALS FOR HUMANS</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'll use this book to learn how to get rid of anxiety so I can finally start doing things I care about.&nbsp; I'll use this book to learn how to handle more anxiety while I do things I care about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not be lonely anymore. Attend at least one group social event every week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want people to judge me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be more accepting of others out on the street and online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stop feeling so much guilt and regret.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn how to practice feeling compassion toward myself and others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Get rid of this uncertainty about whether my partner loves me.&nbsp; Practice expressing myself honestly in a relationship even when I'm afraid of being hurt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any situation it's possible to have a goal you're working toward, even if that goal is simply to breathe. The goals we carry into a situation shape our expectations. Whether our experience aligns with our expectations determines whether we laugh, shout, or cry. So what is your goal with this book? Did you pick up this book in the hope of getting rid of a feeling? Because every rock is already much better than you when it comes to not experiencing that feeling. What's something that only you can do? What's something that you care about that you want to do more of in your life? How will you know if you've achieved that goal?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure your goals are visible. Put them where you'll see them. You might want to write them out on individual pieces of paper so you can put relevant goals where they're more likely to remind you to take action. If you have a goal to sleep more, maybe you need to stick that to your computer so you remember to go to sleep earlier. Take your work goals with you to work. If you have a goal to improve your capacity to experience anxiety, where can you put that goal, physically or digitally, as a reminder to push into anxiety instead of avoiding it?</p></p><h2>Mr. Pine&#39;s Mixed-Up Signs</h2><p>55th Anniversary Edition of <i>Mr. Pine's Mixed-up Signs</i> and the adventures of the intrepid sign painter Mr. Pine.<br><br> Mr. Pine made signs. He made signs that said STOP. He made signs that said GO. He made signs that said FAST. And signs that said SLOW. When the signs in Little Town were old, the mayor said, "we need all new signs." Mr. Pine painted all new signs in one week. "I will put them up," he said, but he could not find his glasses. He put the signs up anyway. The signs were all MIXED-UP! Little Town was all mixed-up! Where were Mr. Pine's glasses? Who had his glasses? How did he solve the problem of all those mixed-up signs?</p><p>Mr. Pine makes signs: "stop," "go," "pets for sale," "gas, 33 cents" (this book was first published in 1961), and more. Little Town is, in fact, plastered with the industrious painter's handiwork, ensuring social order in the way that signs do: "Yes, Little Town had all the signs a town could need." However, when the mayor deems it time to replace the aging, sunbaked, windblown signs, trouble begins. Mr. Pine is pleased to make new signs for the town: "The next week Mr. Pine painted and painted and painted." All would have been well if Mr. Pine had not lost his glasses and installed all the new signs in the wrong places. The sign on the mayor's door said, "This Way to the Zoo!" The sign over the bank said "Bread!" <p> Children will adore Leonard Kessler's short chapter books.

Since the 1976 publication of the first version of The American Ephemeris, 1931-1980, Neil F. Michelsen&#39;s ground-breaking series of ephemerides for astrologers have consistently set standards for accuracy in astrology, becoming indispensible to astrologers worldwide at every level from student to professional. The tradition continues with the addition of this new tropical ephemeris spanning from mid 20th century through mid 21st century, which is published in two versions. This one is calculated for noon UT, and the other for Midnight UT. Rique Pottenger has revised and expanded the Michelsen programming with updated Jet Propulsion Laboratory data and improvements in the computer generating program that, for example, enable finding double ingresses in a single day, plus more accurate station times. A new formula increases the accuracy of the Galactic Center calculation. Other new features have been added, the most obvious of which are the dwarf planets Ceres and Eris, in response to the 2006 decisions of the International Astronomical Union. Monthly positions have also been added for the remaining three of the former four major asteroids in wide use among astrologers, Pallas, Juno and Vesta, and also for the centaur, Chiron. 978-1-934976-27-2 624 pages $29.95</p><p></p><h2>Between Two Trees: Our Transformation from Death to Life</h2><p>The problem of Eden is much worse than you thought, but the solution is much better than you could have ever imagined. <p><i>Between Two Trees</i> reveals that the real tragedy of Eden is a union with death, a union that produces division and despair. Life isn't lived under Eden's tree of life or beneath the healing leaves of the tree in the New Jerusalem. It is lived <i>between</i> them. And between these two trees, life is hard. In spite of this tragedy, <i>Between Two Trees</i> will challenge you to embrace hope, love, and the beauty of reconciliation at the true tree of life: the cross of Calvary. </p><p>By exploring the problem of Eden and the power of the cross, Shane Wood calls us to walk on a path to transformation, a path to union with God. The book s journey ends under the shade of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem with God s unfinished creation now complete. Yes, Eden, but more importantly, <i>you</i>. The unfinished creation in <i>us</i>. </p><p>If you doubt it's possible for one image to tell the whole story from Genesis to Revelation, then you need to read Shane Wood's masterful <i>Between Two Trees</i>. There isn't another book that comes close to it, both in its pioneering methodology and in its brilliance of presentation. I found myself completely absorbed and provoked by my own missed readings of the Scriptures. <br><b>Leonard Sweet</b>, Charles Wesley Distinguished Professor of Doctoral Studies, Evangelical Seminary </p><p>Through theological reflection poised with poetic flare, Shane Wood admirably explores the trials and triumphs of a world united to death yet wooed by a tender father to return home. This book challenges our understanding of the problem of Eden and enhances the revelation of the depths of God's solution in Jesus union with God. Reading <i>Between Two Trees</i>, you will be deeply enriched, tenderly called, and masterfully guided into the transformative power of the incarnate Christ. <br><b>Fr. Richard Rohr</b>, founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation and best-selling author of <i>Everything Belongs</i> and <i>Falling Upward</i> </p><p>A professor of mine once told me I could not understand either the apostle Paul or the Bible until I understood the potency of death. He said Paul was a 'thanatologist,' which means one who studies death. That professor was right, but very few until Shane Wood's excellent, playful, and poetic exploration of the Bible's thanatology have let the specter of death emerge in furious force in their theology. <i>Between Two Trees</i> is a splendid entrance into the heart of Christian theology. <br><b>Scot McKnight</b>, Julius R. Mantey Professor of New Testament, Northern Seminary, and author of <i>The King Jesus Gospel</i> </p><p>The Bible tells a huge story, one big enough to embrace, empower, and transform everyone's story. This book unpacks that huge story as well as any I have ever read. I am so grateful to Shane Wood for giving the church such an insightful and helpful way to understand God's big story. <i>Between Two Trees</i> will help us grasp a better narrative and help us transform our own stories into better tales of redemption. <br><b>Rick Atchley</b>, Senior Teaching Minister, The Hills Church, North Richland Hills, TX </p><p>The Bible opens with a tree, and it closes with a tree. In between, we find an epic tale of God's love for us. Shane Wood knows the metanarrative of Scripture like few others, but what is more important is that he lives its principles every day. He trusts the author who writes the story and the gardener who cares for his creation. Be sure to read <i>Between Two Trees</i> and nurture the fruit within. <br><b>Kyle Idleman</b>, author of <i>Not a Fan</i> and <i>Don t Give Up</i></p></p><p>Shane J.

Shane Wood has accomplished just that. Part autobiography, part theology, and part narrative of the story of every human being, we laugh, cry, agonize, and end with great hope as we see the story of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation with fresh eyes. A delight to read. --<b>Craig L. Blomberg</b>, Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary<br><br><i>Between Two Trees</i> is a contemplative and passionate work that explains in a scholarly yet accessible manner the personal transformation we can all have by knowing Christ Jesus. Shane Wood brilliantly challenges us to cling to hope, love, and life, even while we are in the middle of struggle, strife, and division. I highly recommend <i>Between Two Trees</i> as a guide for your spiritual journey. --<b>Dave Ferguson</b>, Lead Pastor, Community Christian Church, Naperville, IL, and author of <i>Finding Your Way Back to God</i> and <i>Starting Over</i><br><br>Simultaneously honest confession and wise counsel, Shane Wood's <i>Between Two Trees</i> invites us to contemplate life in terms of union and transformation. Anyone looking for new perspectives on old questions about faith and life, about sin and death and God, about being fully human, will be enriched by this book. It guides us toward living between the trees of creation and new creation in light of the tree in the middle: the cross of Jesus. --<b>Michael J. Gorman</b>, Raymond E.

Where will it come from? Can we actually make a difference? How do we remain hopeful?</b></i></b><br><br>Howard Zinn&#x2014;activist, historian, and author of <i>A People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>&#x2014;was a participant in and chronicler of some of the landmark struggles for racial and economic justice in US history. In his memoir, <i>You Can&#x2019;t Be Neutral on a Moving Train</i>, Zinn reflects on more than thirty years of fighting for social change, from his teenage years as a laborer in Brooklyn to teaching at Spelman College, where he emerged in the civil rights movement as a powerful voice for justice. A former bombardier in World War II, he later became an outspoken antiwar activist, spirited protestor, and champion of civil disobedience. Throughout his life, Zinn was unwavering in his belief that &#x201c;small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world.&#x201d; With a foreword from activist and scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, this revised edition will inspire a new generation of readers to believe that change is possible.</p><p>By any standards, Howard Zinn has led a remarkable life as teacher, writer, and social activist, a life in which those three categories are viewed not as compartmentalized tasks but as part of a unified identity. <i>You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train</i>, a title taken from his advice to students about his take on American history and current events, is a powerful testament to that life.<p> It begins with his 1956 acceptance of a teaching post at Atlanta's Spelman College, a school for black women that would soon be caught up in the civil rights movement. Zinn, who had already been radicalized on the streets of Brooklyn as a teenager, got caught up along with his students (who included the future head of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, and author Alice Walker), and was kicked out in 1963 for "insubordination." He moved to Boston University, where he became an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War, and would prove a constant thorn in the side of university president John Silber throughout the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p> Zinn writes in plain language that brooks no nonsense when it speaks of moral urgency, but he isn't above a sense of humor. Noting that the FBI was watching him constantly during the war era, he wryly observes that, "I have grown to depend on them for accurate reports on my speeches." Individual scenes leap out at the reader: Zinn's horror when he realized, years after WWII, that he had dropped napalm bombs on German troops; a meeting in a college classroom with the sister and parents of one of the victims of the Kent State massacre; Selma, Alabama, police beating blacks attempting to register to vote while federal agents stand by and do nothing. Through it all, Zinn writes, "I see this as the central issue of our time: how to find a substitute for war in human ingenuity, imagination, courage, sacrifice, patience." <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><b>Howard Zinn</b> (1922&#x2013;2010) was a world-renowned historian, author, playwright, and social activist best known for <i>A People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>.

But their beauty and charm can equally be adapted to rooms in a Western home. In this book, Des King examines basic shoji making and design. He gives comprehensive background information about shoji and how they have evolved, and detailed step-by-step instructions, supported by many diagrams and photographs, on how to make three shoji with progressively more complex kumiko arrangements, and variations on structure and joinery. Kumiko patterns enhance the uniqueness and charm of shoji, and Des King introduces three different kinds of patterns, and provides detailed instructions on how to make each kind, including dimensional diagrams of jigs that will improve work efficiency. He also dispels many of the myths about the Japanese hand-plane &#x2014; the kanna &#x2014; with an extensive description of how to set up, use and maintain this exceptional tool, including problems that can arise and how to avoid them. Through his highly structured and traditional approach in Book 1, Des King lays solid foundations from which any woodworker can confidently look toward tackling much more complex kumiko patterns and arrangements that can enhance the flair and individuality of shoji in any setting.</p><p>After completing the twelve-month Postgraduate Architecture Course at Shokugei Gakuin, Toyama, Japan in 2009, Des King returned to Australia, and set up a workshop on the Gold Coast, Queensland, where he makes shoji and continues to explore the many advanced kumiko patterns.</p><h2>9 Steps to Heal Your Resentment and Reboot Your Marriage</h2><p><p>Resentful?

No other illustrator has shown such a lively interest in the words and concepts of early childhood. For himself, whenever he was asked how old he was, Scarry would always put up one hand and laugh, saying, "five!"<br><br>Born in 1919, Richard Scarry was raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his children's books. The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually Scarry created many original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic board book&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>. After Scarry married children's textbook writer Patricia Murphy, she wrote many stories for him as Patsy Scarry, including the bestselling Little Golden Books&nbsp;<i>Good Night, Little Bear</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Bunny Book</i>.<br><br>In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print.

She is a lecturer on tarot art as a means for meditation and self awareness.</p>A painter and the designer of the Osho Zen Tarot, Padma combines principles of tarot and the symbols of the I Ching in this illuminated approach to divination. "Tarot is a pillar of wisdom from the West; the I Ching, a pillar of wisdom from the East," she writes. "They are different esoteric paths approaching the same mountain peak." With the aim of helping seekers "look within," Padma offers this dual system. The directions, which are a bit confusing for those unfamiliar with casting, require the seeker to use three coins in order to access the changing nature of his or her question; the lushly illustrated tarot deck gives answers to the question, and the accompanying booklet offers interpretations of these answers. This method not recommended for the novice or the impatient, but it's an interesting new approach for those already comfortable with divination. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Words and Your Heart</h2><p><p><b>Simple, direct, and emotive, Katy Jane Neal's <i>Words and Your Heart</i>&#x2019;s message is that words have extraordinary power&#x2013;to harm and to heal, to create and to destroy, and to spread love.</b></p><p>This book is about your heart (the little bit inside of you that makes you, you!)</p><p>The words we listen to can affect how we feel. </p><p>Some words can do amazing things and make us happy. </p><p>And some words can really hurt us (we all know what sort of words those are). </p><p>Our words have power, and we can choose to use them to make the world a better place.</p></p><p><b>Kate Jane Neal </b>trained at Edinburgh College of Art, studying Ceramics &amp; Painting, and won the Wedgwood New Designer of the year award.

There is so much that I have never said, so many incidents I have never spoken of and so many feelings I have never expressed: great love on one hand; pain, torment, and humiliation on the other. Only I know what really happened between us, why we stayed together, why we parted, and the price I have paid for being John&#x2019;s wife. <b>&#x2014;From the Introduction</b></p><p>This isn't Cynthia Lennon's first book about her legendary ex-husband. <i>A Twist of Lennon</i>--a slim volume that John tried to suppress on grounds of libel--came out in 1978. But now, 25 years after his death, she finally feels ready to tell the "full and truthful story" of their life together. Why? In his foreword, son Julian writes of their being "dismissed or at best treated as insignificant bit players" in the story of John's life; it's Cynthia's goal, with <i>John</i>, to set the record straight. She does make a case for being more than just "the impressionable young girl who fell for him, then trapped him into marriage," and it's moving to read, in his own words, of John's love for his son. And while there's nothing new in her account of the Fab Four's rise to fame, as the greatest success story of the rock era, it's a legend that bears retelling. But most salient of all are Cynthia's sketches of pain, regret, and intimidation. John was indeed a brilliant, loving man, but he was also "passionately jealous," "verbally cutting," sometimes abusive, and often neglectful. (It is hinted that his behavior may have paralleled that of the woman who raised him, his Aunt Mimi.) Unfortunately, Cynthia's "response to John's provocative and cruel behavior was to stick by him more solidly than ever...[feeling] that if he could trust me and believe that I loved him he might soften."<p></p>It's not this dysfunction, however, but rather John's use of LSD, on which she blames the emotional "chasm" that led to the failure of their marriage. And though the Lennons' divorce comes relatively late in the book, the pages that follow are by far the saddest, as they chronicle John's increasing distance from and neglect of his former family--especially Julian, who would only see his father three times after he moved to New York in 1971. It's no surprise that Cynthia lays much of the blame for this at the feet of Yoko Ono, who is described as controlling and insensitive, especially in the wake of John's murder. But even though there's a lot of bitterness and resentment in these pages, it's not overwhelming, being offset by Cynthia's fierce love for her son and her continuing affection for her ex-husband. A full picture of John Lennon's life will never exist as long as Ono judges herself unable to write about their time together, but <i>John</i> goes a long way toward improving the situation. <i>--Benjamin Lukoff</i>Cynthia Lennon was born in Blackpool, England, in 1939. While attending the Liverpool College of Art she met John Lennon. John and Cynthia married in 1962 and their son, Julian, was born in 1963. The Lennons were divorced in 1969. Cynthia retained custody of Julian, who saw his father sporadically until John was killed in 1980. In the years since, Cynthia has been a restaurateur, a designer, and a television personality.

Coleman lives with his family on Long Island.ONE<br><br>He didn't like exposing himself to video cameras when there were no crowds affording him his usual anonymity. His talent wasn't just for killing, but for blending in as well. He was like a khaki-colored pixel in a camouflage pattern. Stare at the pattern long enough and the individual pixels disappear. Today he meant to put the world on notice that he was back and the time had come to repay his creditors. He very much wanted to do both, and had waited more than a year for this opportunity. Still, he couldn't afford carelessness. He was seldom careless. He had taken precautions and the soaking rain was doing its part to cooperate. The gray was so heavy in the air that it seemed like its own weather condition separate from the rain and mist.<br><br>He parked the stolen Yaris out behind the building, because not even he could haul his intended cargo out the front door and hope to get very far. He went through his mental checklist, patted his pockets, and exited the car. He walked through the alleyway, turned right, and then right again. There were people on the street, many people, their heads down against the weather, too busy fussing with umbrellas to take notice of the little bearded man with the long gray hair and porkpie hat shuffling by them. Nor did they notice his large belly beneath the ill-fitting green mackintosh he'd bought at a church thrift shop outside Paradise. While he was unrecognizable, he made certain not to look directly into the security cameras as he entered the building.<br><br>He knocked at the office door, turned the handle, and let himself in. The young man sitting at the reception desk was really quite beautiful to look at. Dressed in an impeccably tailored designer suit of summer-weight wool, he had fine features, long lashes, eyes that matched the deep blue of his suit fabric, and perfectly coiffed dark blond hair. The light stubble on his face was shaved and shaped in such a way as to enhance the power of his angular jawline. He had an ingratiating smile full of straight white teeth. He stood up from behind his desk outside Gino Fish's office to greet the odd-looking little man standing before him, water dripping off the hem of his coat and the brim of his silly hat. Takes all sorts, he thought, and Gino did do business with a lot of unsavory types. The little man took two steps toward the receptionist.<br><br>"How may I help-"<br><br>The beautiful young man never finished his sentence or took another breath. He had been so focused on the odd man's bad gray wig and fake beard that he hadn't seen the blade in the man's small hand. He'd felt it, though, if only very briefly, as the assassin thrust the knife forward. Using his legs like a boxer to supply the necessary power, the little man plunged the razor-sharp blade through the receptionist's tailored suit jacket, his shirt, his perfectly tanned skin, and his breastbone. The blade cut a fatal gash in the young man's heart. With incredible speed and surprising dexterity, the killer removed the blade and thrust it deeply into the receptionist's throat, making sure the mortally wounded man could not cry out. Careful to avoid getting bloody, the killer caught the body by the sleeve and eased it gently to the floor as if placing a sleeping baby in its cradle. There was blood, but not nearly as much as there would have been had the killer reversed the order of the wounds.<br><br>He knelt down beside the results of his handiwork, wiping the blade off on the wool suit before replacing the assault knife back in his pocket. He lingered, admiring the fine features and lovely blue eyes of his victim. He stroked the body's still warm cheeks with the back of his hand. Ran his fingers over his dark blond hair. Shook his head in regret. Just because he lived to destroy didn't mean he had no appreciation of beauty. On the contrary, he had an abiding appreciation for it, though he resented beauty far more deeply. To be human was to possess opposing feelings. In this instance, it wasn't that he so much minded having to kill the man, but that circumstance dictated that he kill him quickly. How much more pleasure could he have derived from the experience had he been able to take his time? He took enormous delight in tearing beautiful things apart by the inch. Quelle dommage, he thought. What a pity.<br><br>He stood; removed the beard, wig, and hat; and placed them all in a plastic bag, then tossed the bag in the trash. Law enforcement already had epithelial and hair samples from any number of his crime scenes. They had samples of his blood from the incidents with Stone's deputy and Joe Breen, but it was of no consequence. They had no name, no face, no person to match them to, only a question mark and a despicable nickname. Sometimes he had to remind himself of his given name and to remember where he'd come from. Now was not the time to dwell on the past.<br><br>He removed the pillow from under his thrift-shop raincoat and, in a cruelly ironic gesture, placed the pillow beneath the murdered receptionist's head. Amused, he checked his watch and smiled. He was very good. Less than a minute had elapsed from the time he'd come into the office until he'd placed the pillow beneath the dead man's head. He retrieved his .22, stepped up to Gino Fish's office door, and knocked.<br><br>"Come on in, Drew," Gino said, his voice almost a purr.<br><br>The killer stepped into the office, closing the door behind him. The aging mobster's head was buried in the Friday edition of The Globe.<br><br>"We should be okay for our weekend on the Cape," Fish said, still not looking up. "Not supposed to rain again until late Sunday."<br><br>"Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Fish," the killer said, gun hand raised. "I'm afraid Drew won't be accompanying you to the Cape this weekend, but don't be sad. I have other more exciting plans for you for the weekend."<br><br>Although Gino Fish had never seen or spoken directly to the man standing before him, he knew immediately who he was.<br><br>"Mr. Peepers. Fuck!"<br><br>The killer was tempted to put a bullet in a very painful but nonlethal area of Fish's body, but he fought the impulse to do so.<br><br>"If you refer to me by that name again, Mr. Fish, I promise you your death will take even longer and be far more painful than you could possibly imagine."<br><br>The old mobster tried to remain calm, though his left hand was trembling. "Then what should I call you?"<br><br>He thought about it, smiled a smug, self-congratulatory smile. "Call me Mr. Mantis."<br><br>Gino didn't argue. "All right, Mr. Mantis. You killed the boy, huh? Did you have to do that?"<br><br>Mr. Mantis nodded. "A shame, I agree. Nice-looking man. My compliments on your taste."<br><br>"This about that thing with Stone that went south?"<br><br>"What else? I warned the people who contacted me for you that if anything went wrong, you would pay the price for interfering in my affairs."<br><br>"I don't suppose there's any bargaining room here?" Fish bowed his head at the gun in the killer's hand. "I can offer you a big sum of cash to put that thing down and walk out of here. I'll see to Drew."<br><br>Mr. Mantis shook his head, smiling all the while.<br><br>"And I don't figure telling you that Vinnie Morris won't let this stand will intimidate you?"<br><br>Mr. Mantis continued shaking his head and smiling.<br><br>"Yeah, I didn't think so."<br><br>The killer motioned with his .22 for Gino Fish to stand.<br><br>"Slowly, Mr. Fish. You and I are going to take a walk down the hall and out the back door of the building."<br><br>Gino Fish didn't move. He was well aware of Mr. Mantis's reputation for sadism. Fish had heard stories about how the man he knew as Mr. Peepers delighted in torturing his victims. He understood that if he left the office with this man, he would suffer a long and horrible death and that his body would probably never be found. For some reason that last part bothered him. Gino Fish was well past his prime, having grown too soft, too comfortable, and too careless, but he was no old fool. He hadn't made it to the top echelons of the Boston mob and stayed there as long as he had by blind luck. He always had a backup plan. Always.<br><br>Mr. Mantis motioned again for Gino to stand, only this time Fish did as instructed. But as he rose, he reached into the open top drawer of his desk, grabbing the old Colt snubnose .38 he'd kept there for many years, just in case. Just in case was now, though he knew better than to try to engage his captor in a shootout. Instead, in one swift motion, he pressed the revolver into the flesh beneath his chin and, without hesitation, pulled the trigger. He hung upright for what seemed a very long second, then collapsed into a lifeless pile of well-dressed skin and bones.<br><br>Mr. Mantis was impressed by the speed with which Fish had acted, but was furious at being robbed of his vengeance. He was also unnerved. Twice recently, he had let victims slip through his fingers, but he didn't have the luxury of time to dwell on it. He knew exactly what to do and how to do it. He removed the assault knife from his coat pocket and moved toward the lifeless body of Gino Fish. Afterward, he retrieved the plastic bag from the trash.<br><br>Less than five minutes later, the odd-looking little man with the long gray hair, ragged beard, and porkpie hat walked out the front door of the building and back into the rain.<br><br>TWO<br><br>After last year's spasm of blood, life in Paradise, Mass, had settled back into its predictable, small-town rhythms: steady as the tides, no waves cresting over the seawalls. There hadn't been a single act of violence for months, the last one being a bar fight among four drunk musicians at the Gray Gull. Oh, there had been some snowfall, but nothing record-breaking, not even a hint of a nor'easter. The spring had passed as if following the script of old rhymes and adages. March had started out blustery and cold and ended on a week of sunny sixty-degree days. It had rained every two or three days in April, and by mid-May the gardens in town were so lush and colorful with early-spring blooms the place looked like . . . well, a paradise. What passed for a crime wave in Paradise these days was a spate of car vandalism. Somebody had lately taken to shooting out the rear tires of cars parked all over town.<br><br>"Anything?" Jesse asked Molly, coming through the station house door on Saturday morning.<br><br>"Nothing worth mentioning."<br><br>"Mention it anyway."<br><br>"No, really, Jesse, there's-"<br><br>"Crane, can't you ever make it easy?"<br><br>"Where's the fun in that?"<br><br>"Fun for who, exactly?"<br><br>"Whom," Molly corrected.<br><br>Jesse shook his head and laughed. "Are you sure it's 'whom'?"<br><br>"I'm not, but it's fun to think you're wrong. Did Diana come down from Boston last night in that rain?"<br><br>"Uh-huh. But don't change subjects. What's not worth mentioning?"<br><br>"Some water got into our basement and we had to turn on the pump."<br><br>"For crissakes, Molly, is that-"<br><br>"I told you it wasn't worth mentioning, didn't I?"<br><br>Jesse raised his hands above his head. "I surrender."<br><br>Molly frowned. "No fun in that, either."<br><br>"No new flat tires?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Jesse turned and went into his office. He picked up his old baseball glove off the desk even before sitting down. He removed the hardball from the pocket of the glove where it resided, slid the glove over his left hand, and marveled that the glove was still in one piece after all this time. The glove had been his when he was a minor-league shortstop for the Dodgers, and he didn't like thinking about how many years ago that was. Nor did he like thinking about why it was sitting on his desk in Paradise instead of in a display case at Cooperstown. For the moment he wasn't worrying about his absence from the Hall of Fame, but rather about the big softball game tomorrow night against the fire department team.<br><br>He had other things on his mind, too. One, a fancy envelope inside the top drawer of his desk, and the recent rash of vandalism. For the moment, he was focused on the latter. Although Mayor Walker and her merry band of selectmen were all over him to do something about it, it was Jesse's experience that the perp was some stupid kid or a cranky old man with a grudge against the town or against Goodyear. He knew that this sort of thing would end soon enough, that the guy doing it would get bored or get sloppy and be caught. Of course there was always potential for things to turn bad. No good ever came of bullets in a populated area. So as Jesse pounded the ball into his glove-it helped him concentrate-he considered ways of catching the shooter in the act.<br><br>He heard the phone ring and Molly answer it. A few seconds later, she was sticking her head through the doorway.<br><br>"It's Robbie Wilson. You want me to tell him you're not here?"<br><br>"No," he said, putting his glove and ball back down on his desk. "I'll take it."<br><br>Jesse generally didn't have much use for Wilson, the chief of the Paradise Fire Department, but he was happy for the distraction.<br><br>"Morning, Robbie."<br><br>"Morning, Chief Stone."<br><br>"So?"<br><br>"Fifty bucks on tomorrow's game?"<br><br>"Gambling's illegal, Robbie."<br><br>"Dinner, then?"<br><br>"Field might be too sloppy to play on," Jesse said.<br><br>"Don't you worry about that. My guys are over there now taking care of it. So, are we on? Dinner to the winner?"<br><br>"How can I turn down an offer from a man who can rhyme dinner and winner? We're on."<br><br>Jesse put down the phone and stared at the top drawer of his desk.<br><br>THREE<br><br>He sat very low in the front seat of the Yaris, not because he was worried he would be recognized, but because caution and invisibility were words he lived by. The stolen car . . . no problem. As was his style, he had removed the nondescript subcompact late at night, from the garage of an elderly person away on a long cruise. He laughed his gloating, superior laugh, thinking about the stupidity of the masses. At how key codes made them feel safe and secure. How typical and how foolish. All he ever needed to do was find his mark, sit on her house for a few days before her trip, and use a long lens to watch her punch in the garage code. He always chose elderly widows because they lived alone, put very low mileage on their cars, and kept their cars well maintained. If he didn't possess such a cautious nature, he believed he could simply trick most people into volunteering their key codes.

We give serious treatment to the underlying theory of financial analysis and valuation, but our main goal is to be able to arrive at a pragmatic answer to the important question, &#x201c;what is this company really worth?&#x201d; To answer this question, we adopt a different approach from other textbooks. The key differences can be summarized as follows:1. Our focus is on generating good financial statement forecasts. 2. We provide detailed practical guidance on how to obtain and analyze relevant real-world data. 3. We demystify the mechanics of equity valuation.Our overriding theme is that good forecasts of the future financial statements are the key input to a good valuation. Most other aspects of the valuation process are mechanical and can be programmed into a computer. In fact, this text refers often to eVal, a fancy Excel workbook that provides a template for these many mechanical tasks and is freely available. As with many other textbooks, we discuss topics like business strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial ratio analysis, and so forth. However, we always do so with a clear view to how these analyses help us to generate better financial statement forecasts. We also provide plenty of advice on where to go to obtain the most relevant raw data. Armed with such a rich source of data, we are able to provide you with plenty of practical examples and limitless opportunities for you to practice doing your own analyses. A final goal of this book is to demystify the valuation process. In the past, we have seen students become lost in a sea of valuation formulas and inconsistent spreadsheet models. For example, students get confused as to whether they should use a DDM, DCF, or RIM valuation formula and whether they need to use the CAPM, APT, or MFM to estimate their WACC (and to how many decimal places). They become obsessed with learning acronyms and formulas but flounder when asked to provide a plausible valuation for an actual company. We demonstrate that these different formulas are easily reconciled and refocus students on developing the best set of financial forecasts to plug into these formulas. This reinforces our main point that the key to good valuations is good forecasts.HOW DOES ALL THIS HELP YOU? The theory of financial analysis and valuation is more compelling when linked to real-world examples. The abstract theory of financial statements, ratios, and valuation formulas can be covered in a few boring lectures. What makes this topic exciting is seeing how an organized approach to studying a real company leaves you so much better informed about the firm&#x2019;s future. Is Apple really worth more than any other public company in the world? The answer is probably yes, once you understand its free cash flow generating ability. Tesla wants to produce and sell hundreds of thousands of cars in the future, but can it generate enough cash from existing sales to fund the production of all these new cars? A careful study of their cash flows shows that they will almost certainly be borrowing lots of money to build all these cars. Financial statements, accounting rules, financial ratios, and valuation models are all pretty dull beasts on their own, but if we can use them to answer questions such as these, we can really bring them to life. By blending the theory of equity analysis with practical application, we feel that students learn both more effectively.The book is supported by a comprehensive set of free online resources, including software, cases, and quizzes, all available at http://www.lundholmandsloan.com</p><p></p><h2>The Shade of the Moon</h2><p><p>The eagerly awaited addition to the series begun with the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller<i> Life As We Knew It, </i>in which a meteor knocks the moon off its orbit and the world changes forever. </p><p>It's been more than two years since Jon Evans and his family left Pennsylvania, hoping to find a safe place to live, yet Jon remains haunted by the deaths of those he loved.

This, he says, is at odds with the ancient tradition of&nbsp;Sabbath as a day of delight for both body and soul. Instead, the only way we can make use&nbsp;of the Sabbath is to see God&#x2019;s original intent for the day with new eyes.

Allender&nbsp;received his MDiv from Westminster Theological Seminary and his PhD in Counseling Psychology from Michigan State University. Currently, Dan serves as Professor of Counseling Psychology and Founding President at The Seattle School of Theology and Psychology in Seattle, WA. A therapist in private practice, he is a frequent speaker and conference leader. He and his wife, Rebecca, are parents to three adult children and grandparents of two grandsons and one granddaughter.</p>In this reflection on the many faces of the Fourth Commandment, Allender (<i>The Healing Path</i>) tries to reinvigorate the Judeo-Christian idea of the Sabbath as a time of joy, celebration and holiness rather than a time for sporting events and grocery shopping. The author, who is president of Mars Hill Graduate School, urges his readers to go play in the fields of God. The book, part of the Ancient Practices series, is founded on three central ideas. The Sabbath is a commandment, not an option. It is not a minivacation but a day of delight. It is also a time for feasting, a remembrance of Eden and an anticipation of eternal life. Allender liberally sprinkles his work with personal anecdotes as he proposes a Sabbath theology that includes time, sensual glory, feasting, ritual, abundance, play and justice. While this volume may be really helpful to those readers seeking to take a fresh look at Sabbath observance,�&nbsp;the often convoluted and confusing prose makes it a bit of a slog. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just&nbsp;cast your eyes past the row of gleaming town&nbsp;houses, with their uniform brick facades and polished&nbsp;brass plaques and, in some cases, packs of&nbsp;paparazzi.&nbsp;<br><br>Then find the one house that looks like the residents&nbsp;are ready to just pack it in and get that condo&nbsp;in Florida.<br><br> That&#x2019;s ours.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t always like this. Great-great-great-great-grandfather&nbsp;Tenpenny made a fortune in shipping&nbsp;and found himself an elegant street (formerly a&nbsp;hardscrabble thicket, or &#x201c;spinney&#x201d;) to build himself&nbsp;not one, but two town houses: one for his wife and&nbsp;children, and an adjoining one for his mother, complete&nbsp;with connecting doorways on each floor.<br><br> As it turns out, this building boom represented&nbsp;the peak of the Tenpenny fortune, and a year later&nbsp;the adjoining town house had been rented out and&nbsp;Grandma moved in with the rest of the family. As&nbsp;time went on, Greenwich Village was abandoned as&nbsp;the city&#x2019;s elite moved farther and farther uptown,&nbsp;but we Tenpennys stayed put.<br><br>On that hot July day, I used my new sneakers to&nbsp;kick the business cards and flyers (&#x201c;Dear Occupant,&nbsp;Do you need cash&#x2014;and quick? Let Town Home&nbsp;Realty handle your home sale!&#x201d;) off the stoop and&nbsp;jiggled the front door&#x2019;s brass doorknob until it finally&nbsp;surrendered.<br><br>No warm welcome here. Just the hot, stale parlor,&nbsp;silent and thick with the smell of musty books and&nbsp;last winter&#x2019;s pop-in from a stray cat. With Jack by&nbsp;my side, the room held a certain artistic-eccentric&nbsp;charm: an antique desk repaired with an oak branch&nbsp;in place of a leg, an ottoman made out of Yellow&nbsp;Pages bound together with sailor&#x2019;s knots, autumn&nbsp;leaves ironed between sheets of waxed paper and&nbsp;wallpapered around the room. But now, alone, with&nbsp;the autumn leaves drifting to the ground as the glue&nbsp;gave out, the place just looked odd, like a stylish&nbsp;great-aunt who has begun wearing her wig backward.<br><br>A breeze from the dining room windows brought&nbsp;in the clucking of our backyard chickens, probably&nbsp;thirsty and impatient for dinner. Jack had started a&nbsp;little garden plot back there in the Great Depression,&nbsp;and now that garden had taken over the entire&nbsp;lot, including not just rows of veggies, but an apple&nbsp;tree, a raspberry bush, and a well-built coop for a&nbsp;fine flock of chickens.<br><br>At least for now. I&#x2019;d lost one this week to a Jurassic-sized&nbsp;rat. Camille had been a tough old broad; she&nbsp;could&#x2019;ve taken that rat. But since Jack died, I think&nbsp;we&#x2019;d all had the fight knocked out of us.<br><br> The grandfather clock in the corner struck five&nbsp;low tones. The chickens would have to wait. It was<br> teatime.<br>The stairs to the second floor creaked under my&nbsp;weight, made heavier by the tarnished silver tray<br> with hard-boiled eggs and a chipped teapot, which I&nbsp;carried like a waitress.<br><br>Using my free hand, I gave three knocks. No&nbsp;answer.<br><br> Mom didn&#x2019;t so much as glance up from her desk&nbsp;as I pushed my way in. From the door I could see&nbsp;beads of sweat running down the back of her neck,&nbsp;below a knot of straw-colored hair bound up absently&nbsp;with a pencil. She wore her terry-cloth bathrobe,&nbsp;even in the stifling, dank room, with its scent of fermenting&nbsp;tea bags and dirty laundry.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got your tea.&#x201d; I set the tray on the floor next&nbsp;to her chair. Mom got pretty agitated if I put anything&nbsp;on her desk, which was blanketed in yellow&nbsp;papers filled with numbers and cryptic characters.&nbsp;She said nothing and continued scratching a&nbsp;pencil on her latest legal pad.<br><br>Jack said my mom was always a bit &#x201c;off,&#x201d; even as a&nbsp;little girl. It&#x2019;s not that she was crazy or even slow. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;just that she always preferred the world inside her&nbsp;mind to the world outside.<br><br>I can understand this, not having much to do with&nbsp;the neighborhood kids myself. I&#x2019;ve never met one&nbsp;who could even tell you the difference between a&nbsp;standard and a Phillips head. But Jack said Angelika&nbsp;was different than all that. She used to go out,&nbsp;help with chores, go to school. Her teachers and&nbsp;professors used words like &#x201c;genius&#x201d; and &#x201c;extraordinarily&nbsp;gifted.&#x201d; But as the years went by, she withdrew&nbsp;deeper and deeper within herself, and now here she&nbsp;was, at her childhood desk in her childhood room,&nbsp;working on a dissertation that NYU stopped expecting&nbsp;over fifteen years ago.<br><br>Since Jack&#x2019;s death, she&#x2019;d started refusing to leave&nbsp;her desk at all, save for her daily morning walk to&nbsp;the tea shop, where she religiously collected every&nbsp;variety they sold. But I caught her last week trying&nbsp;to leave the house in her bathrobe, so clearly things&nbsp;were going south.<br><br> My dad I don&#x2019;t know at all. My mother barely did&nbsp;either. Jack said he was a grifter who seduced my&nbsp;mom just to get his hands on the deed to our house.&nbsp;He sent the guy running.<br><br>I started to gather up the stray teacups from the&nbsp;windowsill, crouching to snag a few from under<br> the bed.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the dissertation going, Mom?&#x201d;<br><br> Scritch scratch.<br><br> &#x201c;Solving any theorems?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I thought I&#x2019;d made a breakthrough, but&nbsp;clearly the unique factorization approach won&#x2019;t<br> work.&#x201d; She shook her head, never looking up from&nbsp;her notepad. &#x201c;Unique factorization. Silly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; I sat down on the bed and its tangle of&nbsp;sheets. &#x201c;Mom, have you given any more thought&nbsp;to what we talked about? About selling the house?&nbsp;We could get a lot of money for it, I think. And we&nbsp;could get an apartment somewhere else in the city,&nbsp;maybe Brooklyn or Queens or somewhere cheaper&nbsp;like that.&#x201d;<br><br> Mom&#x2019;s pencil paused in the air, and she turned&nbsp;her sallow face slowly to stare at me. &#x201c;What house?&#x201d;&nbsp;she asked, her voice low.<br><br> &#x201c;Um, this one?&#x201d;<br><br> She dropped her pencil, her hands shaking. &#x201c;Sell&nbsp;this house? But where would I work? My desk has&nbsp;always been right here. It&#x2019;s the perfect place; I can&nbsp;see the birds in the tree outside. See their nest?&nbsp;That&#x2019;s just where I look when I am working on an&nbsp;equation. And my bed is right here,&#x201d; she waved her&nbsp;hand in my direction, &#x201c;in the perfect spot, so the&nbsp;light can fall on my pillow in the morning. Sell the&nbsp;house? No, no, no, it&#x2019;s just not possible.&#x201d; Her voice&nbsp;became higher and thinner as she shook her head&nbsp;wildly, and I noticed she had started winding a loose&nbsp;thread from her bathrobe tightly around one finger.&nbsp;&#x201c;And where would I buy my tea? Madame Dumont&nbsp;always has the perfect blend ready&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Mom, okay. We&#x2019;re not going anywhere,&#x201d; I&nbsp;broke in. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because all my papers are here, my archives, you&nbsp;see.&#x201d; She frantically pawed the piles and scraps that&nbsp;surrounded her. &#x201c;And I still have to organize them,&nbsp;put them in order, and my footnotes&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not selling the house, okay?&#x201d; I stood up&nbsp;brusquely, knocking two teacups off her book-cluttered&nbsp;night table, which rolled under the bed.&nbsp;&#x201c;But, Mom, I&#x2019;m serious. We can&#x2019;t afford all this.&#x201d;&nbsp;My hand waved over the mess, as if I were surveying&nbsp;the Taj Mahal. &#x201c;And when winter comes, there&#x2019;s the&nbsp;gas bill and the electric bill. I&#x2019;m not sure how much&nbsp;longer the boiler is going to hold out. How are we&nbsp;going to pay for that?&#x201d;<br><br> Now she was humming again.<br><br> &#x201c;Mom, are you sure Jack didn&#x2019;t mention anything&nbsp;about a secret stash? Somewhere he would have hidden&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know, money? Jewels? You know, like a&nbsp;treasure?&#x201d;<br><br> No answer.<br><br> I began to collect the teacups again. &#x201c;Should I&nbsp;bring up some dinner in a little while?&#x201d;<br><br> I looked up to see her dangling the Lipton tea&nbsp;bag in front of her eyes, hot drops of tea splattering&nbsp;the papers that carpeted the floor. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my vanilla&nbsp;Rooibos?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The Rooibos tea is gone, Mom. And that&#x2019;s what&nbsp;I&#x2019;m talking about. You can&#x2019;t buy these expensive teas&nbsp;from the shop anymore. I got this kind for you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But vanilla Rooibos is my afternoon tea. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;made with Madagascar vanilla, which is the finest vanilla,&nbsp;at least that&#x2019;s what Madame Dumont says. I&#x2019;ll&nbsp;get some more in the morning. Madame Dumont&nbsp;said she&#x2019;d have a new shipment of Golden Assam&nbsp;ready for me . . .&#x201d;<br><br> I closed the door behind me as my mother began&nbsp;to methodically categorize the differences between&nbsp;Indian and Chinese tea leaves.<br> After tending to the garden, the chickens, and some&nbsp;clogged gutters, I took my own dinner to the top&nbsp;floor and the room that was once Jack&#x2019;s studio. Jack&nbsp;and I had traditionally sat down together in the old&nbsp;dining room, where we&#x2019;d spoon up our rice and&nbsp;beans on the Tenpenny china and then send our&nbsp;dishes back down to the kitchen in the dumbwaiter.&nbsp;But now the big dining table felt cold, even in the&nbsp;heat, and I preferred to eat somewhere more filled&nbsp;with Jack&#x2019;s presence.<br><br> The studio was stuffy with paint fumes, and I&nbsp;cracked the tall windows that lined the studio&#x2019;s<br> back wall, letting in the relative cool of early evening&nbsp;and snatches of rush hour car horns. From my&nbsp;favorite spot on the long window seat, you could&nbsp;see the block&#x2019;s patchwork of yards below and catch&nbsp;glimpses of the Hudson River. Sometimes I&#x2019;d sit&nbsp;and watch the pigeon flocks swoop back and forth&nbsp;over the rooftops. Funny how something so ragged&nbsp;on its own can become so beautiful when banded&nbsp;together.<br><br> As I ate, I riffled through the mail I&#x2019;d brought up&nbsp;with me. One official-looking letter, with a large seal&nbsp;featuring an American eagle, fell to the floor. The&nbsp;return address: the Department of Veteran Affairs.<br> To whom it may concern:<br><br> The Department of Veterans Affairs was&nbsp;recently alerted of the death of&nbsp;John Thornton Tenpenny V.&nbsp;This letter is to notify you that all existing&nbsp;and future VA pension benefits will be hereby&nbsp;terminated.<br><br>Please accept our condolences at this time of&nbsp;your bereavement. Mr. Tenpenny&#x2019;s sacrifice and&nbsp;service to his country are deeply appreciated.&nbsp;<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br><br> Roger D. Fowlke<br> Department of Veterans Affairs<br> I read the letter several times over. Veterans Affairs?&nbsp;When I did my sixth-grade history fair project&nbsp;on World War II, Jack told me he sat out the whole&nbsp;thing on account of his asthma. It seemed strange&nbsp;that the VA would hand out pensions to 4-Fs with&nbsp;breathing issues.<br><br>More to the point, the letter meant that Jack had&nbsp;run the household with money I&#x2019;d never known<br> about. Money that had now dried up.&nbsp;I put the letter down and reached for a Mason&nbsp;jar, tucked in with assorted paint cans and bottles of&nbsp;paint thinner. The jar had once held some sky blue&nbsp;paint, now dried and opaque, which hid the bills&nbsp;and coins inside. Jack had always kept five hundred&nbsp;dollars in this jar, spending it down to the pennies,&nbsp;and then replenishing with a fresh five hundred&nbsp;from some unknown source.<br><br> Once, when I was around five, Jack caught me&nbsp;trying to sneak some change out to buy a candy&nbsp;bar. He roared&#x2014;the only time he ever directed his&nbsp;famous temper at me&#x2014;enraged more by the betrayal&nbsp;than the theft. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a magic jar,&#x201d; I gasped&nbsp;between my sobs. &#x201c;You take money out, and it always&nbsp;comes back.&#x201d; He got down on one knee, his strong,&nbsp;paint-flecked hands gripping my shoulders. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not&nbsp;magic. It&#x2019;s hard work that fills that jar. The hard work&nbsp;of earning the money, and the harder work of keeping&nbsp;it.&#x201d; His hands moved to my cheeks, wiping the&nbsp;tears into his calloused palms. &#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t cry, sister.&nbsp;You&#x2019;ll see&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll make sure there&#x2019;s always money to be&nbsp;found.&#x201d;<br><br>Tonight I poured out the jar&#x2019;s contents and&nbsp;counted it again&#x2014;$384. On the day Jack died, there&nbsp;had been $463. I guess I was lucky that he died only&nbsp;a week after refilling the jar. From that day forward,&nbsp;I had done the hard work of keeping what we had:&nbsp;eating only from the garden and the pantry, avoiding&nbsp;our few functional appliances even as the red-lined&nbsp;utility bills kept streaming through the mail slot. I&#x2019;d&nbsp;even given up the Laundromat, hand-washing my&nbsp;sweaty clothes in the kitchen sink and drying them&nbsp;on the backyard line.<br><br>Still, no matter how hard I worked, the money&nbsp;couldn&#x2019;t hold out forever. Jack was right&#x2014;the only&nbsp;magic around here was the money&#x2019;s disappearing&nbsp;act.<br><br>That left us only one lifeline: Jack&#x2019;s promised&nbsp;&#x201c;treasure.&#x201d; I popped a last raspberry in my mouth&nbsp;and crossed over to the studio&#x2019;s defunct fireplace,&nbsp;where atop a grand marble mantel a chicken egg sat&nbsp;in a small ceramic bowl.<br><br>My first official chore in the Tenpenny house had&nbsp;been the placement of that egg. Every morning, Jack&nbsp;and I would gather the chickens&#x2019; output and select&nbsp;the whitest, most perfect egg of the lot. The rest of the&nbsp;half dozen or so went to the kitchen. The egg of&nbsp;honor went to the mantel. Jack would lift me in his&nbsp;arms, and I&#x2019;d gently place the egg in the bowl made&nbsp;by my grandmother, a woman I knew only through&nbsp;Jack&#x2019;s stories of her skill at the potter&#x2019;s wheel and&nbsp;her fine Scandanavian cooking.<br><br>&#x201c;A new day, a new beginning, a new chance at a&nbsp;new ending,&#x201d; Jack would intone solemnly. It was as&nbsp;close as he ever got to morning prayers.&nbsp;<br><br>The egg would sit in its place of honor through&nbsp;the day until it was replaced by the next morning&#x2019;s&nbsp;selection, when it joined the other eggs in the kitchen.<br><br>But for that one day, its only job was to echo the&nbsp;painting above it. One of Jack&#x2019;s earliest pieces,<br> the canvas was an abstract, a dark swirling abyss of&nbsp;midnight blues, black like charred wood, and gray&nbsp;like the dawn. And floating in this void was a stark&nbsp;white oval that haloed the real egg below.<br><br>Canvases came and went in Jack&#x2019;s studio&#x2014;sold,&nbsp;lent, shown&#x2014;but this one stayed above the mantel,&nbsp;supervising the Changing of the Egg each morning.&nbsp;Jack said he&#x2019;d never sell it. I don&#x2019;t think I ever saw&nbsp;him so much as move it for dusting.<br><br> That was before The Spot on Spinney Street. And&nbsp;his last words.<br><br> Since then, every night after dinner, I worked into&nbsp;the last moments of the day&#x2019;s light to find out whether&nbsp;there was anything &#x201c;under the egg&#x201d; at all.<br><br>Maybe &#x201c;under the egg&#x201d; was just the last random&nbsp;outburst of a blood-soaked brain. But Jack always&nbsp;said he&#x2019;d take care of me. He always said I&#x2019;d find out&nbsp;when I was ready. It stood to reason that, whatever&nbsp;there was to find, was indeed under the egg.<br><br>The only problem was that &#x201c;under the egg&#x201d; could&nbsp;mean a lot of things&#x2014;and whatever it meant, I hadn&#x2019;t&nbsp;figured it out. Standing on a chair I&#x2019;d dragged over, I&nbsp;was still surprised by how much heavier this painting&nbsp;was in my arms than ...</p><h2>Tier One (Tier One Thrillers, 1)</h2><p><p>In a world violated by terror, the old lines have blurred.

She sat looking at pink and orange streak across the sky as she drank a cup of steaming Chinese tea, stretched out on an ancient, faded broken deck chair she had bought at a yard sale. A weather-worn wooden statue of Qan Ying observed the scene peacefully. Qan Ying was the goddess of compassion, and the statue had been a treasured gift. Under the benevolent gaze of Qan Ying, the pretty auburn-haired young woman sat in the golden light of the sunrise, as the early summer sun shot copper lights through her long wavy hair, which hung nearly to her waist. She was wearing an old flannel nightgown with barely discernible hearts on it, and her feet were bare. The house she lived in sat on a plateau in Bolinas, overlooking the ocean and narrow beach below. This was exactly where Coco wanted to be. She had lived here for four years. This tiny forgotten farm and beach community, less than an hour north of San Francisco, suited her perfectly at twenty-eight.<br><br> Calling her home a house was generous. It was barely more than a cottage, and her mother and sister referred to it as a hovel or, on better days, a shack. It was incomprehensible to either of them why Coco would want to live there&#x2014;or how she would even tolerate it. It was their worst nightmare come true, even for her. Her mother had tried wheedling, insulting, criticizing, and even bribing her to come back to what they referred to as "civilization" in L.A. Nothing about her mother's life, or the way she had grown up, seemed "civilized" to Coco. In her opinion, everything about it was a fraud. The people, the way they lived, the goals they aspired to, the houses they lived in, and the face-lifts on every woman she knew. It all seemed artificial to her. Her life in Bolinas was simple and real. It was uncomplicated and sincere, just like Coco herself. She hated anything fake. Not that her mother was "fake." She was polished and had an image she was careful to maintain. Her mother had been a best-selling romance novelist for the past thirty years. What she wrote wasn't fraudulent, it simply wasn't deep, but there was a vast following for her work. She wrote under the name Florence Flowers, a nom de plume from her own mother's maiden name, and she had enjoyed immense success. She was sixty-two years old and had lived a storybook life, married to Coco's father, Bernard "Buzz" Barrington, the most important literary and dramatic agent in L.A. until his death four years before. He had been sixteen years older than her mother and was still going strong when he died of a sudden stroke. He had been one of the most powerful men in the business, and had babied and protected his wife through all thirty-six years of their marriage. He had encouraged and shepherded her career. Coco always wondered if her mother would have made it as a writer in the early days without her father's help. Her mother never asked herself the same question and didn't for an instant doubt the merit of her work, or her myriad opinions about everything in life. She made no bones about the fact that Coco was a disappointment to her, and didn't hesitate to call her a dropout, a hippie, and a flake.<br><br> Coco's equally successful sister Jane's assessment of her was loftier, though not kinder: Jane referred to Coco as a "chronic underachiever." She pointed out to her younger sister that she had had every possible opportunity growing up, every chance to make a success of her life, and thus far had thrown it all away. She reminded her regularly that it wasn't too late to turn the boat around, but as long as she continued to live in a shack in Bolinas like a beach bum, her life would be a mess.<br><br> Her life didn't feel like a mess to Coco. She supported herself, was respectable, she didn't do drugs and never had, other than the occasional joint with friends in college, and even that had been rare, which was remarkable at that age. She wasn't a burden on her family, had never been evicted, promiscuous, pregnant, or in jail. She didn't criticize her sister's lifestyle, and had no desire to; nor did she tell her mother that the clothes she wore were ridiculously young, or that her last face-lift still looked too tight. All Coco wanted was to be her own person and lead her own life, in the way she chose. She had always been uncomfortable with their luxurious Bel-Air lifestyle, hated being singled out as the child of two famous people, and more recently the much younger sister of one. She didn't want to lead their life, only her own. Her battles with them had begun in earnest after she had graduated with honors from Princeton, went to Stanford law school a year later, and subsequently dropped out in her second year. It had been three years since then.<br><br> She had promised her father she would try law, and he assured her there was a place for her in his agency. He said it helped to have a law degree if you were going to be a successful agent. The trouble was she didn't want to be one, especially working for her father. She had absolutely no desire whatsoever to represent best-selling authors, scriptwriters, or badly behaved movie stars, which were her father's passion, bread and butter, and only interest in life. Every famous name in Hollywood had come through their house when she was a child. She couldn't imagine spending the rest of her life with them, as her father had. She secretly believed all the stress of representing and indulging spoiled, unreasonable, insanely demanding people for nearly fifty years had killed him. It sounded like a death sentence to her.<br><br> He had died during her first year in law school, and she stuck it out for another year and then dropped out. Her mother had cried over it for months, still berated her for it, and told her she lived like a homeless person in the shack in Bolinas. She had only seen it once, and had ranted about it ever since. Coco had decided to stay in the San Francisco area after dropping out of Stanford. Northern California suited her better. Her sister Jane had moved there years before, but commuted to L.A. frequently to work. Their mother was still upset that both her children had moved north and fled L.A. although Jane was there a lot. Coco rarely went home.<br><br> Coco's sister Jane was thirty-nine years old. By the time she was thirty, she had become one of the most important film producers in Hollywood. She'd had a dazzling career so far, and eleven record-breaking box-office hits. She was a huge success, which only made Coco look worse. Her mother never stopped telling Coco how proud their father had been of Jane, and then she'd burst into tears again, thinking about her younger daughter's wasted life. Tears had always worked well for her, and got her everything she wanted from Coco's father. Buzz had thoroughly indulged his wife and adored his daughters. Coco liked to believe at times that she could have explained her choices, and the reasons for them to him, but in truth she knew she couldn't have. He wouldn't have understood them any better than her mother or sister did, and he would have been both baffled and disappointed by her current life. He'd been thrilled when she got into law school at Stanford, and hoped it would put an end to her previously extremely liberal ideas. In his opinion it was all right to be kind-hearted and concerned about the planet and your fellow man, as long as you didn't carry it too far. In her college days and before, Buzz thought she had, but he had assured her mother that law school would get her head on straight. Apparently it hadn't, since she dropped out.<br><br> Her father had left her more than enough money to live on, but Coco never touched it, she preferred to spend only what she earned, and often gave money away to causes that were important to her, most of them involved in ecology, the preservation of animal life on the planet, or to assist indigent children in Third World countries. Her sister Jane called her a bleeding heart. They had a thousand unflattering adjectives for her, all of which hurt. Coco readily admitted that she was a "bleeding heart," however, which was why she loved the statue of Qan Ying so much. The goddess of compassion touched her very soul. Coco's integrity was impeccable, and her heart was huge and constantly focused on kindness to others, which didn't seem like a bad thing to her, nor a crime.<br><br> Jane had caused her own ripples in the family in her late teens. At seventeen, she had told her parents that she was gay. Coco had been six at the time, and unaware of the stir it made. Jane announced that she was gay in her senior year in high school and became a militant activist for lesbian rights at UCLA, where she studied film. <br><br> Her mother was heartbroken when she asked her to be a debutante, and Jane refused. She said she'd rather die. But in spite of her different sexual preferences, and early militancy, essentially she had the same material goals as her parents. Her father forgave her once he watched her set her sights on fame. And as soon as she achieved it, all was well again. For the past ten years Jane had lived with a well-known screenwriter who was a gentle person and famous in her own right. They had moved to San Francisco because of the large gay community there. Everyone in the universe had seen their films and loved them. Jane had been nominated for four Oscars but hadn't won one yet. Her mother had no problem now with Jane and Elizabeth living as partners for the past decade. It was Coco who upset them all deeply, who worried the hell out of them, annoyed them with her ridiculous choices, her hippie life, her indifference to what they thought was important, and it made her mother cry.<br><br> Eventually, they blamed Coco's attitudes on the man she was living with when she dropped out of law school, rather than their effect on her for years before. He had lived with her during her second and final year of law school, and had left law school himself without graduating several years before. Ian White was everything her parents didn't want for her. Although smart, capable, and well educated, as Jane put it, he was an "underachiever" just like her. After leaving school in Australia, Ian had come to San Francisco, and opened a diving and surfing school. He had been bright, loving, funny, easy-going, and wonderful to her. He was a rough diamond and an independent sort who did whatever he wanted, and Coco knew she had found her soul mate the day they met. They moved in together two months later, when she was twenty-four. He died two years later. They were the best years of her life, and she had no regrets, except that he was gone, and had been for two years. He died in a hang-gliding accident, when a gust of wind crashed him into the rocks, and he fell to his death below. It was over in an instant, and their dreams went with him. They had bought the shack in Bolinas together, and he left it to her. His wet suits and diving gear were still at the cottage. She'd had a hard time for the first year after he died, and her mother and sister had been sympathetic in the beginning, but since then their sympathy had run out. As far as they were concerned, he was gone, and she should get over it, get a life, grow up. She had, but not the way they chose. That was a capital offense to them.<br><br> Coco herself knew that she had to let go of Ian's memory and move on. She had been out on a few dates in the last year, but no one came close to Ian. She had never met a man with as much life, energy, warmth, and charm. He was a tough act to follow, but she hoped that someday someone would come along. They just hadn't yet. Even Ian wouldn't have wanted her to be alone. But she was in no hurry. Coco was happy living in Bolinas, waking up every day, facing each day as it came. She was on no career path. She didn't want or need fame to validate herself, as the rest of her family did. She didn't want to live in a big house in Bel-Air. She didn't want anything more than she'd had with Ian, beautiful days and happy times, and loving nights, all of which she knew she would carry with her forever. She didn't need to know where her next steps would lead, or with whom. Each day was a blessing unto itself. Her life with Ian had been absolutely perfect and exactly what they wanted, but in the last two years since his death, she had made her peace with being on her own. She missed him, but had finally accepted that he'd gone on. She wasn't frantic to get married, have children, or meet another man. At twenty-eight, none of that seemed pressing, and just rolling along in Bolinas was more than enough for her.<br><br> At first, living there had seemed odd to her and Ian as well. It was a funny little community. The local residents had chosen years before not only to be inconspicuous but to virtually disappear, like Brigadoon. There were no road signs to indicate how to get to Bolinas, or even to admit that it was there. You had to find it on your own. It was a time warp that they had both laughed at and loved. In the sixties it had been full of hippies and flower children, many of whom were still there. Only now they were weather beaten and wrinkled and had gray hair. Men in their fifties or even sixties, headed for the beach with their surfboards under their arms. The only shops in town were a clothing store, which still sold flowered muumuus and everything tie-dyed, a restaurant full of grizzled old surfers, a grocery store with mostly organic food, and a head shop that sold every possible kind of paraphernalia and bongs in all colors, shapes, and sizes. The town itself sat on a plateau that hung over a narrow beach, and an inlet separated it from the long expanse of Stinson Beach and the expensive houses there. There were a few beautiful homes tucked away in Bolinas, but mostly there were families, dropouts, older surfers, and people who, for whatever reason, had chosen to get away and disappear. It was an elitist community in its own way, and the antithesis of everything she had grown up with, and the high-powered family Ian had fled in Sydney, Australia. They had been perfectly matched that way. He was gone now, but she was still there, and she had no intention of leaving anytime soon, or maybe ever, no matter what her mother and sister said. The therapist she had seen after Ian died, until recently, had told her that she was still rebelling at twenty-eight. Maybe so, but as far as Coco was concerned, it worked for her. She was happy in the life she had chosen, and the place where she lived. And the one thing she knew for sure was that she was never, ever going back to live in L.A.<br><br> As the sun rose in the sky, and Coco went back inside for another cup of tea, Ian&#x2019; s Australian shepherd, Sallie, sauntered slowly out of the house, fresh from Coco&#x2019; s bed. She gave a faint wave of her tail, and headed off on her own for a morning stroll on the beach. She was extremely independent, and helped Coco in her work. Ian had told her Australian shepherds made great rescue dogs, and were herders by instinct, but Sallie marched to her own tune. She was attached to Coco, but only to the extent she chose to be, and had her own plans and ideas at all times. She had been impeccably&nbsp;trained by Ian, and answered to voice commands.<br><br> &nbsp;Sh...</p><h2>Francois Halard: A Visual Diary</h2><p><b>This volume presents the famed photographer's newest lush images of the stunning interiors of acclaimed designers, artists, and tastemakers.</b><br><br>Francois Halard's unique photographic sensibility--old-world elegant and bohemian, accessible and personal--is unmistakable.

The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

His fans have been treated to the best-selling Flaming Pie and Standing Stone albums, a full hour of Paul on "Oprah," and this thoughtful and comprehensive biography that brings us closer to the man than ever before. Based on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews over a period of five years, and with complete access to Paul's own archives, Barry Miles has succeeded in letting Paul tell the story of his life as a Beatle in his own words. It includes Paul's recollection of the genesis of every song that he wrote with John Lennon and the fascinating details about their remarkable collaboration.</p></p><p>If you think John Lennon was the smart, arty Beatle while Paul was an empty head twittering prettily, this book will hip you to the facts. While John sat in the suburbs getting stoned to numb the pain of his imminent divorce, bachelor Paul was feeding his head by immersion in the London avant-garde. He pioneered the Beatles' experimental stuff, though his witty song-by-song account proves that it really was a 50-50 partnership--and some of the best innovations, like the snarling 1964 feedback intro to "I Feel Fine," happened by pure accident. Paul's insight into John's genius, which sprang from howling paranoia and a stark childhood, is still deeper than his insight into himself, but the book's true glory is its inside info on all those songs--the six tunes about John's marriage on <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>; Paul's heist of the "I Saw Her Standing There" bass line from Chuck Berry's "I'm Talking About You" (found on Berry's <i>The Chess Box</i>); the true meanings of "Norwegian Wood" (pine paneling, which the song's narrator burns to avenge the girl's refusal to have sex with him), "Got to Get You into My Life" ("you" is marijuana), and "Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da" ("life goes on" in Yoruba). This book is even better than <i>A Hard Day's Write: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song</i> and <i>Revolution in the Head</i>. Here is the last word on the Beatles, inevitably slanted toward McCartney but generally more convincing than Lennon's own recollections. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><p><b>Barry Miles</b> (known as Miles) has known Paul McCartney since the 1960s.

Some struggle to redefine these categories and some seek to reclaim them, while others reject them outright, with or without providing new terms to guide us forward.</p><p>But words and their meaning matter; our confusion has a cost. Competing priorities pressure us to stretch our mission definitions as wide as they can go, releasing our people to creatively engage in service of every description. Some churches turn away from traditional mission efforts all together, giving preference to local service and evangelism while outsourcing any cross-cultural effort to those who surely must be more effective than we would be.</p><p>As an unfortunate result of these tendencies, many of our churches lack a coherent, compelling sense of what we're all about as we engage with the world.

The great men and women of God down through the ages have testified to the effectiveness of this in their lives. Some like Martin Luther, have said that they could not survive a busy day without spending 2-3 hours alone with God. Drawing on the experiences of people like Luther, Spurgeon, Muller, Whitefield and Wesley, the author presses the case for a greater commitment to prayer. His advice may not only transform your life, it could be a catalyst towards a change in the world around you.</p></p><p>David McIntyre (1859 &#x2013; 1938) was a Scottish preacher and Principal of the Bible Training Institute in Glasgow from 1913 to 1938."God brings books at their appointed times. <i>The Hidden Life of Prayer</i> arrived late but well-timed. This little jewel-strewn tapestry has done for me at 64 what Bounds' <i>Power Through Prayer</i> did at 34. I could be ashamed that I need inspiration for the highest privilege. But I choose to be thankful." (John Piper ~ Founder of Desiring God Ministries, Chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary, Minneapolis, Minnesota)<br><br>"I have read <i>The Hidden Life of Prayer</i> again and again since Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia first gave it to me when I visited there as a prospective student forty years ago. Every time I read this book, the Lord uses it to deepen my prayer life and encourage my faith. I strongly recommend it!" (Wayne Grudem ~ Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies, Phoenix Seminary, Phoenix, Arizona)<br><br>"We hardly get a glimpse today of the prayer life which this book gives evidence. Hardly surprising that it comes recommended by such men as Geoff Thomas, Wayne Grudem and John Piper. Read it slowly and let the author instruct you in prayer." (The Evangelical Magazine ~ Published by Evangelical Movement of Wales)<br><br>"It was in 1971 I first read this book I was shown a copy in Al Martin's home and he told me how he used it, which plan I took up enthusiastically and have used ever since. I have read it through aloud during a week of morning meetings with various assistants and with deacons before they have started work... Every time I read it I discover something fresh, convicting and helpful. The book does not make you afraid of prayer. It has a fragrance of Disruption times and the Awakening in the middle of the 19th century, in fact the author was born in that great year of 1859. He later married the daughter of Andrew Bonar and that warm piety and close walk with God characterizes this, McIntyre's best book.

I have my mission." - Blessed John Henry Newman</p> <p>The statistics are heartbreaking. In 2007, 24 percent of Americans identified as Catholic. By 2014, that had dropped to 21 percent. The number of people who claim no religious affiliation has surpassed Catholics and evangelicals, making "nones" the largest religious group in the United States. Catholics are simply walking away from the Church.</p> <p>Yet there are many committed, faithful Catholics who desperately want to stem this tide. We are here, in this moment, and are called to be part of the mission, for the sake of our members, and for those who are still outside the Church. Yet while we long for this renewal, we are often at a loss as to how to accomplish it in a practical way. What steps do we take? How do we start, and how do we continue? How will we measure success - and how long will it take?</p> <p>In <b>Made for Mission: Renewing Your Parish Culture</b>, author and speaker Tim Glemkowski offers four keys that can radically change parish culture: </p><ol> 1. Cast the vision 2. Prioritize a clear path to discipleship 3. Mobilize leaders 4. Align everything </ol> Implementing these four keys over time, parishes can become not simply gathering places for worship but seedbeds of discipleship and missionary outposts of the New Evangelization. This book is a must-read for Catholic clergy, lay parish staff, anyone working in ministry, and any dedicated parishioner who is passionate about renewing the Church.<p></p> <p><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b></p> <p>Tim Glemkowski is an international speaker and the founder and president of L'Alto Catholic Institute.

The pigs are named Trosclair, Thibodeaux, and Ulysse (also know as Boo), and their antagonist is Ol' Claude, the alligator of <i>Petite Rouge</i> infamy (Dial, 2001), who finishes off the straw and stick houses with a flap of his tail: 'Oh piggy,' say Claude with dat big gator smile,/'Could I come inside of you house for a while?'/Dat's when Trosclair shout, '<i>No!</i> I won't let you in;/Not by all dem hairs dat I got on my chin.' The gator is let off easy at the end: he is nursing a burnt tail from an encounter with Ulysse's roux, but is rescued by the pigs from becoming gumbo. Harris's amusing watercolor-and-pencil illustrations mirror the text with �lan; they are full of funny details that beg to be looked at again and again (the little mouse is also back). Front matter includes a glossary of some Cajun words and a note about the rhyme scheme that facilitates reading the story aloud. Although Cajun variations on folktales are becoming plentiful, this one should not be missed.<i>&#x2013;Judith Constantinides, formerly at East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in Southern California.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3 A Halloween offering that is sure to be snatched up year-round by children on the prowl for scary books. The rhymes are full of repetitions that give the text the quality of a chant. These marching rhythms advance a band of Halloween creatures along a winding country road. Bunting's strong verbs and Brett's clean, clear line drawings and vivid palette bring a devil, skeleton, ghost, etc., to life, and the effect is exciting but not in the least sinister or fear-inspiring. (Bunting's language does become a bit turgid at points, however.) The creatures are a troupe of spirited trick-or-treaters, but this is not known by the mother cat who tells story. Nor are readers aware of the identity of the narrator at the beginning. But as the parade progresses, and three more little eyes appear in the dark, readers begin to get a sense of those eyes warily watching the spectacle from a safe distance. Brett creates skillful shifts in visual perspective and effectively interprets the book's final turnabout: the tiny eyes, mere points of light, clustered under a house, are hidden so long as the trick-or-treaters are about. But when all is quiet, they suddenly blossom into cats that form their own parade and claim Halloween, just as the rising golden harvest moon at the book's beginning blossoms into a milky moon above them. Carefully planned and executed, illustrations and text nicely unified, this is well designed for group use and a fine introduction to Halloween story programs.

The Greek translation was originally created for use by the Alexandrian Jews who were fluent in Koine Greek, but not in Hebrew. Thus the Septuagint is sometimes called the &#34;Apostle&#39;s Bible&#34; and the one that Jesus and his disciples would have had access to. It is quoted in the New Testament by writers such as the Apostle Paul, and remained the Scripture of use by the Apostolic Fathers. The translation of the Septuagint into English by Sir Lancelot C. L. Brenton was first published in 1851 and was based primarily upon the Codex Vaticanus, one of the oldest extant manuscripts of the Greek Bible. It remains the standard of use by many scholars and students of Scripture and history.

Armed with pranks like glue in the shampoo bottles and flying toast missiles, the robots demand to be cared for. It's up to Sammy and his disabled sister Maddie to keep the peace until his mom reveals her secret project . . . and why it was worth the wait.<br></p><p>James Patterson received the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community at the 2015 National Book Awards. He holds the Guinness World Record for the most #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Middle School</i> and <i>I Funny</i>, and his books have sold more than 325 million copies worldwide.

He has donated more than one million books to students and soldiers and funds over four hundred Teacher Education Scholarships at twenty-four colleges and universities.

While Sammy's brilliant inventor mom is wrapped up with top-secret research, the rest of the household is starting to slip. Sammy and his second-best friend, Trip, are having trouble with their science project, and Sammy's sister Maddie still can't attend school because of her compromised immune system. The robots are feeling neglected, and E's idea to spice things up by having the robots switch jobs leads to humorous misadventures amid a robot rebellion and cries of "Viva la Roboluci�n!" Authors Patterson and Grabenstein know what tickles a middle schooler's funny bone and artfully insert nontraditional role models. Narrator Jack Patterson keeps the clever voices and accents coming&#x2014;from the twang of robot Hayseed to the snooty tones of dislikable classmate Randolph R. Reich. Brisk chapters (about three minutes each) move the action along. Although listeners do not have access to Juliana Neufeld's illustrations (featured prominently in the print book), Jack Patterson's lively narration fills the gap.

But as soon as the misty-eyed nurse placed you in the nest of my arms, you quit crying, opened your eyes, and locked your gaze with mine. That instant of serendipity was fleeting because it wasn&#x2019;t more than a few seconds that your birth mother was out.</p><p>When she came to, and I was there, cuddling this lighter-than-air you that she had grown inside herself for nine long months, I begged for forgiveness. But she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you got to hold her first. You&#x2019;ve been here this whole dern time too.&#x201d;</p><p>I had given birth myself before, and that teary first introduction to a new life after a forty-week hormone roller coaster was fresh in my mind, still damp like the coat of paint on the wall in your nursery. But I&#x2019;d never been on my feet, outside the bed, when four were breathing the air and then, with one tiny cry, there were five. To experience that kind of wonder is like being born again.</p><p>Even in that resurrection moment, I couldn&#x2019;t have known that one day, I would get to hold you, swaddled and warm, all the time. But I did swear that I would do everything in my power to protect you, love you, and make sure you grew up good and slow as salad greens.</p><p>And so, my love, if you ever look at your book and think maybe it&#x2019;s a little thicker than your sister&#x2019;s and your brother&#x2019;s, it&#x2019;s only because instead of having one mother to save snapshots and write letters and remind you how much she loves you, you have two: the one who brought you into the world and the one who brought you up in it. And if you ever start feeling like maybe you got dealt a bad hand, that having a mother who raised you and a mother who birthed you is too tough, just remember this: You can never have too many people who love you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jodi</p><p>JAM LEFT ON TOO LONG</p><p>Some things in life, they don&#x2019;t even seem right. Like how you can preserve something grown right there in your own backyard and have it sitting on your pantry shelf &#x2019;til your kids have kids. And how them women down at the flea mall can write a whole Bible verse on one of them little grains of rice. And then there&#x2019;s the thing I know right good: how ripping-your-finger-off-in-the-combine awful it is for a momma to have to give up her baby.</p><p>I think you already got to realizing, looking at me right now, messin&#x2019; in your momma and daddy&#x2019;s white, shiny kitchen, that I ain&#x2019;t just your daddy&#x2019;s cousin. &#x2019;Course, you&#x2019;re still so little now, you cain&#x2019;t know how I grew you in me, how I birthed you, how I loved you and still do. But you give me that same crooked smile my daddy had and squeeze my finger real tight&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s like you know it all. Whenever I say that to your momma, she says back, &#x201c;Of course she knows. Babies know everything.&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s a right simple thing to say. And simple is who I am and what I&#x2019;ve been knowing my whole life. I cain&#x2019;t say a lot of fancy things, and I don&#x2019;t believe in making excuses as to why I&#x2019;m not doing your raisin&#x2019;. So here&#x2019;s the boiled-down-lower-than-jam-left-on-too-long truth: I gave you up &#x2019;cause I loved you more than me. I gave you up &#x2019;cause I wanted you to have more. I gave you up &#x2019;cause, in some, murky way, like that river that runs right through town, my heart knew that it&#x2019;d take giving you up for us to really be family. I used to tell your momma I was scared that being in your life was gonna hurt you. But then she&#x2019;d tell me, right simple: You can never have too many people who love you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Khaki</p><p>OTHER PLANS</p><p>My favorite interior design clients have always been those who approach me with file folders with magazine clippings seeping over the edges like overfilled cream puffs. They like the feel of this room, the light of this one. They can&#x2019;t live another day without a chaise precisely like that.</p><p>I&#x2019;d always been like one of those clients, totally in touch with what I wanted. So when your daddy Graham and I got married, I knew we&#x2019;d have lots of babies. I already had your brother, Alex, of course. But when he was born it was different. I was a very young widow living in Manhattan full time, my design business and antiques store taking off. In short, I was busier than a Waffle House waitress when third shift let out.</p><p>But once I moved back home to North Carolina and married your daddy Graham, his calming demeanor and being so close to nature soothed my soul like a raw potato on a cooking burn. I wanted to breathe deeply, feel the sun on my face, and watch my children grow.</p><p>I was dreaming about Graham and me rocking on the porch watching Alex and his two little sisters&#x2014;little sisters that he didn&#x2019;t have&#x2014;play, when I woke up that Sunday morning, my arm tingling numb from being up over my head. I looked down to see Alex nestled in the crook of my body, his arms splayed wide in that unencumbered, worriless sleep of children. He was snoring on one side, Graham snoring on the other, the three of us snuggling like a litter of puppies in the barn hay. I smiled at how the morning sliver of sun peeking through the small opening in the curtains glistened off of my three-year-old&#x2019;s blond strands.</p><p>Graham yawned, opened his eyes, and leaned to kiss me. His muscular grip wrapped around me as I shook my practically dead arm, the pins-and-needles feeling burning through me. &#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, Khaki,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>My name was really Frances, but Graham had changed it nearly two decades earlier when I used to dress in head-to-toe khaki work clothes and ride around the farm with my daddy. It was one of those nicknames that had grown like creeping ivy and been impossible to escape.</p><p>I looked back down at Alex&#x2019;s closed eyes, smiled at his legs propped on mine, and whispered to Graham, &#x201c;Do you have any idea how many times we&#x2019;ve had sex in the past two and a half years?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mmmm,&#x201d; he hummed, nuzzling his face into my hair, his unshaven chin pricking my cheek. &#x201c;I like where this conversation is going.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Four hundred sixty-two times.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to know that someone is keeping track. Are you saying that&#x2019;s too much or not enough?&#x201d; He grinned that boyish grin at me, his blue eyes flashing, and said, &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;d err on the side of not enough, personally.&#x201d;</p><p>I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Come on, Graham. Why the hell am I not pregnant? I mean, how hard can it be? I wasn&#x2019;t even trying for Alex, and &#x2018;bam!&#x2019; just like that.&#x201d; I snapped my fingers, ignoring the fact that I had been only twenty-six then. I tried to push away the thought of that declining fertility chart the OB-GYN had shown me at my last appointment. He had said, &#x201c;Well, at your age it just takes a little longer.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d made Graham and me feel like a couple of forty-eight-year-olds asking for some sort of miracle, not thirty-one-year-olds on a very reasonable quest for their second child.</p><p>Graham shrugged and yawned. &#x201c;Maybe my guys don&#x2019;t want to swim in the winter. Maybe it&#x2019;s too cold. Maybe we should wait until summer.&#x201d;</p><p>I crossed my arms, my nostrils flaring. He pulled me in closer and kissed my cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on, pretty girl, you know I&#x2019;m just teasing you. We&#x2019;re going to have lots more babies and fill this house up.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up at him, my lower lip protruding the slightest bit. He kissed it back in place, leaned his forehead on mine, and whispered, &#x201c;I promise. I&#x2019;d never let my girl go &#x2019;round not getting something she wanted.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled, my heart feeling that familiar, practically lifelong surge of love for my childhood sweetheart, when Alex rolled over, looked around sleepily, and laid his head on my lap. &#x201c;Hey, Mommy?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, sweetie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can we have bacon for breakfast?&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed and ran my hand through his shaggy hair. &#x201c;You can take the boy out of the hog farm, but you can&#x2019;t take the hog farm out of the boy.&#x201d; I pulled him up and gave him a firm kiss on the cheek that was still plump and juicy as a ripe tomato.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we might be out of bacon, but I know some grandparents who never run out of pork.&#x201d; I pinched his side and said, &#x201c;You go brush your teeth, and we&#x2019;ll go over there.&#x201d;</p><p>Graham perked up, and, rubbing his tight stomach, said, &#x201c;I need a big ole Pauline country breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>Pauline had worked for Mother and Daddy my whole life on the farm, and she made the best homemade biscuits and gravy in the world. I shook my head. &#x201c;I will take Alex to Mother and Daddy&#x2019;s. Then, when I get home, if you impregnate me, you may have a Pauline breakfast as a reward.&#x201d;</p><p>He whistled and rubbed his hand down the back of my silk gown. &#x201c;Oh, baby, I love it when you get so romantic with me.&#x201d;</p><p>I slapped his thigh and pointed my finger at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not teasing you. I&#x2019;m getting Alex ready, and you better concentrate on producing some of that fine Jacobs baby-making sperm.&#x201d;</p><p>When we pulled up to the end of Mother and Daddy&#x2019;s driveway I took a moment to marvel at how the giant oaks, each of them having been there for centuries longer than the home itself, grew together into a green canopy, the ideal frame for the white plantation home that graced their ending. I had an entirely new feeling about this house now, its white columns of Pantheonic proportion that were so quintessentially Southern.</p><p>When I was younger, coming home equated to poorly chosen words and hurtful digs from my mother. Maybe it was becoming a grandmother or the general smoldering of temper fire that comes with aging, but my once impossible-to-please mother&#x2014;though still a force to be reckoned with&#x2014;had become much, much more pleasant.</p><p>Alex unsnapped his booster, jumped out of the car, and flew through the front door before I could even say, &#x201c;Hey, wait up!&#x201d; or wrangle him into his coat.</p><p>He always got as excited as a jewelry collector at a Christie&#x2019;s auction to see his grandparents. It was the same way I felt when I saw Daddy, that mixture of love and pride that swirls together like a backroom science project. Mother stepped out onto the front porch, her sassy hair perfectly styled in keeping with the same Chanel suit she&#x2019;d been wearing for decades. I felt myself unwittingly roll my eyes. She leaned over to hug my son. We still didn&#x2019;t always see eye to eye, but Mother could have slapped some butter on Alex and eaten him right up like one of Pauline&#x2019;s homemade biscuits.</p><p>Instead of following Alex through the front door, I walked around to the side, smiling at Pauline&#x2019;s imposing figure turning bacon on the griddle at the opposite side of the blue-and-white tiled kitchen while she hummed &#x201c;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.&#x201d; When she heard the screen door slam, Pauline wiped her molasses-colored hands, almost the same size as the eye on the antique stove, on the apron puckering over her thick waist. She wrapped me in a hug and said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with my baby?&#x201d;</p><p>I had a smile on my face and hugged her back as hard as I could, and Pauline still knew something was wrong with me. &#x201c;I was just wondering why you&#x2019;re back here frying bacon when I tried my damnedest to bust you out.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed heartily and shrugged. &#x201c;Had to come back. You was the one that introduced me and Benny, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>Pauline had met her second husband and late-life love when she, Mother, and Daddy had come to New York to help after Alex was born. They had started their life together there, but, as I knew all too well, you simply can&#x2019;t take the South out of the girl. Much as I would imagine one would want to escape the claws of my momma, not a year later, Pauline was back like a homing pigeon, Benny in tow. When I confronted her, jaw agape, about why she hadn&#x2019;t run far, far away, she said simply, &#x201c;You know, baby girl: You and Miz Mason and Daddy Mason&#x2019;s my family.&#x201d;</p><p>And so we were, which was even more evident when Pauline said, &#x201c;Come on, baby. You can tell Pauline.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat down on the stool beside the range, my lifelong Pauline-talking perch, and said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get pregnant.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked me up and down. &#x201c;&#x2019;Course you cain&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>I crossed my arms. &#x201c;Why on earth not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Girl like you cain&#x2019;t get pregnant. You ain&#x2019;t nothing but skin and bones.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at myself. I was naturally thin. But maybe the stress of traveling back and forth to New York for work was getting to me. Or perhaps the vegan diet and yoga kick I&#x2019;d been on was too much. The hormone-balancing book I read said it would help me conceive. But every month I was more disappointed than the last when that minus sign appeared on the EPT. &#x201c;You think that&#x2019;s all it is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Course,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You was lookin&#x2019; healthy when you got pregnant with little man.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded, thinking that, who knows, maybe I was just too thin. Pauline might not have been a doctor, but she was always right. Feeling sorry that I was kissing three months of sprouts, flaxseed, and leafy greens good-bye, I grabbed two crispy pieces of bacon off Pauline&#x2019;s drip pan and crunched. I was a hog farmer&#x2019;s daughter, after all. Bacon was my birthright.</p><p>&#x201c;Good girl.&#x201d; She nodded. &#x201c;Now you get on outta here and come back for some breakfast when you&#x2019;re good and pregnant.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed, and she added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep an eye on little man.&#x201d;</p><p>Lying in bed an hour later with my legs propped on the headboard&#x2014;I had read somewhere that elevating your legs helps the sperm find their target&#x2014;Graham kissed me and said, &#x201c;I just feel like it took that time, babydoll.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled weakly. &#x201c;I sure hope so.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go get ready for church while you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He paused, circled his finger around where I was lying, and said, &#x201c;While you do whatever it is that you&#x2019;re doing there.&#x201d;</p><p>An hour later, sitting in church, light streaming through stained-glass windows, Graham&#x2019;s arm around me, Daddy beside me, and Alex playing down the dark wood pew, I felt the strongest message from heaven that I had before or since: I was going to be a mother again.

Little Bear loves rowing, fishing, and floating in his little rowboat. Then he begins to grow, and one day his new heft sinks the boat. His mother calms him: "It is a little bear's destiny to grow and grow till he is a BIG BEAR. It is a little boat's destiny to stay the same size." Bear is sad, and he worries that no one will love his boat now that he can no longer fit into it. All ends happily, though, when Bear decides to bequeath the boat to another Little Bear, repeating his mother's warning: little bears become big bears, and the boat must eventually be passed on. Surprisingly few stories touch on the nostalgia and fear a new stage of childhood can bring. With just a few sentences per page, this is a sensitive, affecting story about growing up and leaving favorite things behind, with charming ink-and-paint illustrations that echo the spare clarity of the words.

In this new book, full-color maps unravel the braided knot of California's water infrastructure and ecosystems, exposing a history of unlimited growth in spite of finite natural resources&#x2014;a history that has led to its current precarious circumstances. Yet this built world depends upon the biosphere, and in&nbsp;<i>The State of Water</i>&nbsp;Kaufmann argues that environmental conservation and restoration efforts are necessary not only for ethical reasons but also as a matter of human survival. Offering nine perspectives to illustrate the most pressing challenges facing California's water infrastructure, from dams to species revitalization, Kaufmann reveals pragmatic yet inspiring solutions to how water in the West can continue to support agriculture, municipalities, and the environment. Interspersed throughout with trail paintings of animals that might yet survive under a caring and careful water ethic, Kaufmann shows how California can usher in a new era of responsible water conservation, and&#x2014;perhaps most importantly&#x2014;how we may do so together.</p><p>Growing up in the East Bay as the son of an astrophysicist and a psychologist, Obi Kaufmann spent most of high school practicing calculus and breaking away on weekends to scramble around Mount Diablo and map its creeks, oak forests, and sage mazes. Into adulthood, he would regularly journey into the mountains, spending more summer nights without a roof than with one. For Kaufmann, the epic narrative of the California backcountry holds enough art, science, mythology, and language for a hundred field atlases to come. When he is not backpacking, you can find the painter-poet at his desk in Oakland, posting @coyotethunder #trailpaintings on social media.&#x201c;Invites paddling around until you discover something fascinating, which you do, often. And of course, there are the illustrations. Kaufmann&#x2019;s watercolors shimmer with delicacy and drama.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter Fish, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><p>&#x201c;Obi Kaufmann dives fearlessly and joyfully into the maelstrom that is <i>The State of Water</i> in California. Luscious illustrations reveal that joy, accompanied by text that faces historic challenges and a troubled future head on. This is not a book with a political agenda, other than 'to point out our agreements over our differences,' yet Kaufmann's concern for moral integrity points toward better ways we might compete for out limited water resource. With words and images the book affirms that 'water is life.' Let's lift a glass of the precious stuff to the hope that every Californian will read <i>The State of Water</i>.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Carle, author of <i>Introduction to Water in California</i> and <i>Water and the California Dream</i></p><p>&#x201c;Equal parts pragmatism and whimsy, this exploration of water in California by the artist-naturalist Obi Kaufman is a delight from start to finish. A kind of scientific wonder cabinet, this splendidly illustrated reference manual has something for anyone interested in water in the Golden State. From sturgeon and river otters to vernal pools and diversion dams, <i>The State of Water</i> offers fresh new ways of thinking about California's waterscape that replenish and revitalize the groundwater of our aquatic imagination.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Kowalewski, Lloyd McBride Professor of English &amp; Environmental Studies, Carleton College</p></p><h2>A Big Day for Baseball (Magic Tree House)</h2><p><b>Meet Jackie Robinson and solve a mystery in the #1 bestselling Magic Tree House chapter book series! </b><br> &nbsp;<br> PLAY BALL!

Jack sat on his front porch steps. His chin was cupped in his hands.&nbsp;<br> Annie came out the front door.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you want Mom to take us to the rec center now?&#x201d; she asked. It was the day for baseball tryouts.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided not to go,&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> Annie sat down next to him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asked.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about last season&#x2019;s&nbsp;tryouts,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I fell down when I swung the bat.

Annie grabbed it.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a baseball!&#x201d; she said.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where did it come from?&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> He and Annie walked to the sidewalk and looked up and down their street. No one was there.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s from another world,&#x201d; whispered Annie. She handed the ball to Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;What other world?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Think about it,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;One second, we&#x2019;re talking about baseball&#x2014;and how we don&#x2019;t want to go to tryouts. The next, this baseball drops from the sky!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh. You mean&#x2014;&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Morgan!&#x201d; Jack and Annie said together.&nbsp;<br> Annie took off down the sidewalk. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; she called to Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hold on!&#x201d; Jack shouted. He put the mysterious ball inside his backpack and raced after Annie.&nbsp;<br> Jack and Annie crossed the street and dashed into the Frog Creek woods. They hurried between the trees until they came to the tallest oak.&nbsp;<br> <i>The magic tree house was back.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Yay, team!&#x201d; said Annie. She grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up. Jack followed her into the tree house.&nbsp;<br> Leaf shadows danced on the wooden floor. Two gray baseball caps sat in the dappled light.&nbsp;<br> Next to the caps was a book: history of baseball. A red leather bookmark was sticking out from the pages.&nbsp;<br> Jack picked up the book and opened to the bookmark. The page showed a photo of a baseball stadium. The caption beneath it said:&nbsp;<br> <b>Ebb</b>e<b>ts Fi</b>e<b>ld, </b>B<b>rooklyn, </b>Ne<b>w </b>Y<b>ork, April 15, 1947&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Ebbets Field?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard of that. It was a famous ballpark.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look, there&#x2019;s a message on the bookmark,&#x201d; said Annie.&nbsp;<br> Jack held the bookmark up to the light.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Morgan&#x2019;s handwriting!&#x201d; he said. He read aloud:&nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2019;Twas a big day for baseball&nbsp;</i><br> <i>So many years ago.&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Journey to Ebbets Field&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To learn what you should know.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Learn what we should know?&#x201d; repeated Jack. &#x201c;To become better ballplayers?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sounds like it!&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Morgan must have known about the tryouts.&#x201d; She read the next verse:&nbsp;<br> <i>These caps are magic&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Made only for you&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To give you the skill&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To know what to do.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Oh, man, it sounds like these caps will make us great players!&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yay!&#x201d; said Annie. She read on:&nbsp;<br> <i>As long as you wear them&nbsp;</i><br> <i>All others will see&nbsp;</i><br> <i>The skillful people&nbsp;</i><br> <i>You&#x2019;re pretending to be.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;I get it! Everyone else will see us as great players!&#x201d; said Annie.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In a Little League game?&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Little League teams must have played at Ebbets Field, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, probably all kinds of teams played there,&#x201d; said Jack.&nbsp;<br> Annie read more:&nbsp;<br> <i>When you hear the final score,&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Give the ball with the name&nbsp;</i><br> <i>To the one who knows best&nbsp;</i><br> <i>The rules of the game.&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Our baseball has a name?&#x201d; said Jack. He pulled the ball out of his pack and turned it over in his hands. &#x201c;No name here.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, maybe we&#x2019;re supposed to give it one,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;How about Ballee?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ballee?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, okay. How about Fly Ball?&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;It flew down to us.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine, whatever,&#x201d; said Jack. He put Fly Ball back into his pack. &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes! This is going to be so much fun,&#x201d; said Annie.&nbsp;<br> Jack pointed at the photo of Brooklyn, New York. &#x201c;I wish we could go there!&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;<br> The wind started to blow.&nbsp;<br> The tree house started to spin.&nbsp;<br> It spun faster and faster.&nbsp;<br> Then everything was still.&nbsp;<br> Absolutely still.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Life Is Tremendous</h2><p>Believing that enthusiasm makes the difference, Charlie shows how anyone can be happy, involved, relevant, and secure in the midst of a high-pressure, commercialized, automated society.</p><p>Life is Tremendous!

My moment of spiritual awakening came like Bill W.'s, the cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, who describes his moment of spiritual awakening in the form of a bright white light--only for me the light was blue and in my rearview mirror.<br><br>When the rookie cop got out of his patrol vehicle and walked up to my car, I thought I recognized him. He could have been a pediatric patient of mine, now grown up in jackboots and a Smokey hat. He told me that I had been wandering between the lines. I said, "Well, I thought that's where I was supposed to be--between the lines, that is."<br><br>I then did what any other red-blooded American alcoholic might do having the time, knowledge, and inclination: I blew out the side of my mouth so his Breathalyzer test wouldn't work and so I could buy myself some time. On the way to the police station, I faked a hypoglycemic attack to bring out the entire rescue squad so they would become witnesses who could help explain my behavior. This would look good in court, I told myself.<br><br>Then I hired a detective. We went back to the scene of the crime and videotaped all the stripes on that highway and saw that some of those stripes wiggled and varied, a scenario that could give rise to the theory that it had only been an optical illusion that my car had been weaving. It also pointed to the possibility that the Vermont road crew who painted the lines was loaded at the time. As if that weren't enough, I hired a chemist to refute my blood alcohol level reading by explaining that at that temperature and at that time, in the middle of the night, and given the toothpaste I was using, all tests were, in all probability, invalid.<br><br>After examining the arrest record of this young cop, the detective and I determined he was probably a stalker who had followed many a bar employee home, stopping them and forcing them into DUI checks. I was just another victim. So we amassed a lot of evidence, and I spent a fortune because there was no way a guy like me was going to go down. I was a doctor with the gift of defiance and grandiosity, the perfect storm for an alcoholic.<br><br>We were preparing for trial when my lawyer said, "Hey, Doc, before we go to trial, would you like to see the videotape?"<br><br>"What videotape?"<br><br>"The videotape of your arrest that was made by the chief of police who was training the rookie cop. The chief, who's known you for 30 years and could have stopped the arrest, thought it was time you got a little help."<br><br>"Has anyone else seen this videotape?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes," he replied. "Just the state medical board and the district attorney."<br><br>A MATTER OF CHOICE?<br><br>We can define disease as a loss of function of an organ or organ system that produces a set of symptoms with a known or an unknown cause. For example, diabetes has a target organ, the pancreas. We know the cause, which is a dysfunction in insulin production or in insulin's action at the cellular level. And the effect is that the body becomes glucose intolerant, which results in high blood sugar levels that, over time, damage organs with small blood vessels, including the eyes, the kidneys, and the heart.<br><br>Diabetes is a chronic, lifelong, incurable disease that is absolutely treatable. A patient with diabetes follows dietary, exercise, and medication instructions to attempt to normalize blood sugar levels. But if left untreated, diabetes takes its toll on the body. Chronic elevated blood sugar levels cause the small blood vessels in the peripheral nerves, eyes, heart, and kidneys to thicken, eventually occluding proper bloodflow. This can result in pain, numbness, and tingling in the lower extremities; destruction in the retina; early susceptibility to heart attack; and, most especially, renal failure--the awesome consequences of a disease run rampant.<br><br>Are these consequences preventable? Often, the answer is yes. If the diabetic follows a daily treatment regimen, she can live to be 100. Left untreated, diabetes is a fatal disease. That is, it must be treated one day at a time. You don't get credit today for the insulin you took last week.<br><br>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is another example of a chronic, lifelong, fatal disease, treatable but not curable. The target organ system for MS is the brain and central nervous system. It is a chronic, organic disease of the brain with a relapsing and remitting pattern that may come and go with devastating symptoms.<br><br>For many years, alcoholism and drug addiction were considered a weak person's inability to control desire. Most people believed that drinking was simply a matter of choice and that anyone with a drinking or drug problem was reckless, self-absorbed, and irresponsible. Research dating back to the 1950s, however, has led most medical professionals, myself included, to understand that addiction is not a moral issue but a disease-- a brain disease to be specific, and one that has genetic links. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) continue to do important research on the complex genetic disorder known as addiction.<br><br>We have proof. Addiction is a disease. So why do most people, including addicts and their family members, find this fact difficult to accept? Perhaps it's because addicts and alcoholics seeking their drug of choice have done some pretty bad things, transgressing the boundaries of society and the law. No doubt, an addict's behaviors can be intolerable. Living with an addict can bring family members to the brink of insanity.<br><br>But addiction is a brain disease with signs and symptoms manifested in part as behaviors. And like diabetes or MS, alcoholism and addiction have a target organ, a cause, and an effect, which we call symptoms.<br><br>THE TARGET ORGAN OF ADDICTION<br><br>The disease of alcoholism and drug addiction affects one of our more precious organs: the midbrain (more appropriately called the survival, or reptilian, brain), an area located just below the upper, or thinking, brain. It is called the reptilian brain because it is the only brain that reptiles have and the only brain they have ever needed to survive for hundreds of millions of years. The midbrain dictates survival behaviors: to move away from danger and toward food; to breathe in and out; to eat and to rid the body of the waste products; and, of course, to procreate. These survival behaviors require reinforcement so that they're repeated over and over again by generations to perpetuate the species. That reinforcement comes in the form of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that, when released by the brain, simply makes us feel great.<br><br>When we're parched, we seek water, knowing how good those first gulps of cool water will feel. When we experience orgasm through sexual intercourse, we're encouraged to procreate. These pleasurable feelings are directly related to the midbrain, which encourages us to repeat behaviors that feel good and to avoid those that don't.<br><br>Drugs of abuse affect the midbrain by causing it to release 2 to 10 times more dopamine than natural rewards do. If we're smoking or injecting our drug, the effects can be immediate and long lasting. At first, the "high" is bigger, better, and stronger than the natural high most of us get from pleasurable activities. Our brain rewards us for using drugs, and, drawn to the dopamine, we do it again and again.<br><br>Over time, our brain, overwhelmed by repeated surges in dopamine and other neurotransmitters, adapts. It either produces less dopamine or reduces the number of receptors that can receive dopamine signals. Our natural supply of dopamine plummets, and we have a hard time feeling pleasure from normal activities. At this point, we need to take drugs just to feel normal. If we want to feel the high we once felt, we need to take larger amounts of the drug than we first did--an effect known as tolerance.<br><br>The result is addiction, a condition that keeps us drinking and drugging even after our behavior has started to make us feel bad and negatively affect others.<br><br>THE CAUSE OF ADDICTION<br><br>Disease (excluding infectious disease) is often based on genetics, inherited traits passed down from generation to generation through DNA, and addiction is no exception. The disease of alcoholism and addiction is about 60 percent genetic; the other 40 percent is environmental. What do I mean by that? To experience addiction, we must first trigger the expression of our addiction genes. This is where environment enters the picture.<br><br>Even if we carry the addiction genes and drink or use drugs on occasion, we may never become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Someone who has inherited the genes and grows up in a healthy environment with little or no exposure to drugs and alcohol, and who doesn't experience any major traumatic life events, may never manifest the disease. Are they still genetically an addict or an alcoholic? Yes, they have those chromosomal traits. But the environment has not supported the disease's development. Conversely, someone with very little genetic contribution--three or four generations without a case of addiction or alcoholism in his family--who grows up living over a bar in an inner city, next to a crack house, and hanging out with a gang that's manufacturing methamphetamine and amphetamine has a pretty good chance of developing the disease of addiction primarily because of his environment.<br><br>One way to trigger addiction is to experience stress. Stress causes the adrenal glands to release the hormone cortisol. The stress could be good or bad--marriages or funerals, births or deaths, letters from the lottery commission or letters from the tax collector--it doesn't really matter. All events of significance will stimulate the release of cortisol, which has the effect of raising the dopamine requirements in the person who has the addiction genes--1 in 10 people in the United States.<br><br>Puberty, as luck would have it, is a stressor in and of itself. And we all go through it. Our bodies may differ from our peers in growth and maturity rates, causing us to feel awkward or like we don't belong. We may feel too young for this group and too old for that group. It's during this awkward, stressful stage that many of us are introduced to drugs or alcohol. When using for the first time, we may experience a warm glow or feel our inhibitions replaced by false courage. If we are among the 1 in 10 who are genetically predisposed to addiction, this can be a life-changing event-- many alcoholics and addicts will tell you that the first time they had a sip of alcohol at age 12 or 14, they felt heavenly, normal, and comfortable in their own skin for the first time. We might not develop alcohol or drug addiction in these adolescent years or even in our twenties, but at some point in the future, under specific stressful circumstances, the relief of anxiety and discomfort through alcohol or drugs will be a remembered and welcome event.<br><br>The disease of addiction is very patient. Many who have had this type of euphoric experience with drugs or alcohol go through long periods of training, schooling, and employment where outside factors keep their disease at bay. The same people who say they will never drink before 5:00 p.m. or will never have a drink at lunchtime may find that when their life circumstances change due to financial difficulties, job loss, or the death of a spouse, the floodgates suddenly open. Even retirement can be a trigger: More and more people of retirement age find that their drinking or drugging patterns change dramatically when the structure and constraints of their work life are no longer present.<br><br>Once we establish high dopamine requirements, normal pleasures--a day with the kids, a beautiful sunrise, a painting, or good music--don't seem to satisfy the midbrain's requirements for reward. Something that has worked in the past, such as a surge of dopamine from alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, or an opioid, may serve the purpose.<br><br>I like to think of the carnival game where you hit a block with a big hammer, causing a weight to fly up a cable and ring a bell. Imagine that the bell being rung is a dopamine bell and ringing it on a regular basis is a requirement of survival. We have no choice. We must breathe. We must eat. And we must have reproductive activity to keep ringing the bell. Then a drug like cocaine comes along, causing a surge of dopamine that raises the bell 10 feet on the cable. Suddenly, the hammer, or those things that have caused pleasure in the past (good food, good sleep, sexual activity), isn't effective any-more. A bigger hammer is needed. Like heroin. Like opioids. Like cocaine. Like alcohol. The addictive substance trumps the normal behaviors that ring the bell and becomes a requirement for the bell ringing. In other words, our midbrain sends out cravings for the substance that it deems necessary for survival. The midbrain will require us to seek out the same substance, over and over and over again, until the cycle is broken.<br><br>THE SYMPTOMS OF ADDICTION<br><br>When we have a disease, we call certain traits symptoms, not behaviors. Addiction has its own list of physical symptoms, but it also claims a host of symptoms that affect behaviors. The symptoms of addiction are biological, emotional, social, and spiritual. In the field of addiction, we sometimes call them consequences.<br><br>Biological consequences (of alcohol). All drugs take a toll on the body, but alcohol affects you from head to toe.<br><br>� The brain may shrink or atrophy, like the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease. It's difficult to distinguish between the MRI of an Alzheimer's patient and the MRI of a chronic alcoholic. (Amazingly, brain damage caused by alcohol can often be reversed in recovery, and the brain regains its former size.)<br><br>�&nbsp;The digestive system becomes red or raw and may even bleed from the caustic effects of alcohol.<br><br>�&nbsp;Elevated liver enzymes give rise to fatty liver disease, which may progress to cirrhosis. The liver, shrunken and scarred from cirrhosis, causes a backup of bloodflow that results in varicose veins forming at the bottom of the esophagus, leaving the alcoholic more susceptible to internal bleeding. If internal bleeding does occur, the damaged liver is incapable of producing the blood-clotting factors it's responsible for, so there's nothing to stop the bloodflow. It's not uncommon for the terminal alcoholic to suffer a grotesque form of death--bleeding out through his mouth.<br><br>�&nbsp;The spleen becomes enlarged, which compromises the immune system by destroying valuable disease-fighting white blood cells. This increases the alcoholic's susceptibility to infection.<br><br>�&nbsp;The heart's muscular wall may thin and become flabby, causing the heart to overexpand and pump ineffectively, eventually leading to heart failure.<br><br>�&nbsp;High blood pressure, common in alcoholics, further damages the heart's effectiveness.</p><h2>Barefoot Books Children of the World</h2><p>An immersive, multifaceted picture book designed to offer young readers a glimpse into the diversity of the human experience promotes thought through questions about how other children live, what they eat, what games they play, and how are they different and alike.</p><p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Strickland's latest selection about children around the world begins as an easy picture book and ends as a nonfiction title with explanatory back matter for elementary schoolchildren.

I was honored and humbled to be able to sit and learn these old stories from elders hailing from many First Nations tribes. Comanche, Dineh, Apache, Anishinabe, Aztec, Cherokee, Creek, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Mohawk are a few of the tribes whose elders shared their beautiful stories with me. I listened eagerly to these accounts that were passed down from generation to generation while understanding filled my spirit and I was asked to pass these stories along to the next generation.These are stories that were told before missionary contact and I realized with each story that I listened to I had heard them before...not from my tribe but from another ancient tribe who has left an impacting legacy on the earth called The Bible. The Creator planted the seed in my heart to write this book as a way to help build the bridge of reconciliation between the nations. You might laugh, cry, sing for joy or wail from the deepest parts of your soul. Betrayal, love, reconciliation, unity, sacrifice, joy, peace, history, archaeology, science, the perseverance of the human spirit and the longing for Creator to heal our land and broken hearts. A longing for our spirit to be uplifted from the only One who can give us Hope in the face of utter defeat and despair. I was humbled being entrusted with hearing these stories and was given permission to retell them so they can be shared with the world.

By eliminating uneeded layers of management and allowing employees unprecedented democracy in the workplace, he created a company that challenged the old ways and blazed a path to success in an uncertain economy.</p><p>It can if you think like Ricard Semler, the maverick CEO who turned his own company into a model for the 90's and beyond. In MAVERICK, Semler will tell you how he changed his company and how you can change yours...if you dare!<p>The extraordinary true story of 34-year-old CEO Ricardo Semler and of the rebirth of his family owned Brazilian manufacturing company, Semco. MAVERICK is a chronicle of corporate change--a change so vast and successful that Semco has been visited by over 400 corporate representatives from around the world who want to see it in action.</p><p>In 1980, 21-year-old Ricardo Semler took over the reins of the company his father founded and built. Ricardo proceeded to break every rule of doing business, firing an entire echelon of upper level managers. Once he opened the floodgates to change, Semler never--even when he was tempted to--closed them again.</p>,p&gt;Semler's management system allows employees to work at home, study and discuss the company's financial statements, make corporate decisions, take over the cafeteria kitchen, start their own business with company assets, and redesign the products Semco builds and how they are built. The result: in 10 years of constant experimentation--a time period in which Brazil's economy faltered--Semco has achieved a growth rate of 600%!<p></p><p>In chronicling Semco's inner revolution, Semler shows how his radical ideas and strategies, as well as his nuts and bolts specifics, can be applied to any company anywhere.</p>Ricardo Semler took over his father&#39;s company, Semco (founded in 1954), at the age of 19. Not only did he turn the company round, he made it an outstanding success. On the brink of bankruptcy in 1980, Semco achieved revenues of $34 million in 1993 - and $160 million in 2000. Semler threw out the rule book: for example, workers make their own decisions; every corporate decision is put to the vote; people turn up to the meetings they want to be at. It sounds insane: but it works.</p><h2>Marvelous Mermaids (I Heart Drawing)</h2><p><b>Internationally known illustrator and bestselling author Jane Davenport takes artists on a journey through the mysterious world of mermaids, explaining everything from accurately drawing the figure to creating convincing habitats with mixed-media techniques.</b><br><br> Make a magical mermaid splash!

He is the author of <i>The Price of Experience</i>, <i>LAbyrinth</i>, <i>The Miracle Detective</i>, and <i>Untouchable</i>. He lives in Oregon.Sullivan (The Price of Experience) strikes again in the arena of California true crime, exploring the sordid world of big money, gangsta rap, guns and drugs. Opening with the shooting of a black man by a white man during a traffic incident, Sullivan underscores the not-so-well-known racial tempest brewing on the West Coast especially when he reveals that the shooter was an undercover narcotics investigator and the man killed was an off-duty L.A.P.D. officer who moonlighted for the disreputable Death Row Records. From here, Sullivan outlines the bad and the ugly of the music industry: mafioso-style music label management; the unsolved murders of rap superstars Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.; and a dizzying series of binary oppositions Crips vs. Bloods; West Coast rappers vs. East Coast rappers; Death Row Records' exec Suge Knight vs. Puffy Combs of Bad Boy Records, etc. Unfortunately, the basic material isn't exactly new; journalists Ronin Ro and Cathy Scott, among others, have previously covered the murders of Shakur and B.I.G. Still, Sullivan's reportorial writing style accurately reflects the investigative work of homicide gumshoe Russell Poole while building the drama within the truly labyrinthine political coverups, cop-to-criminal crossovers and the breaks in the L.A.P.D.'s code of silence.

Now revised and updated with new resources and including full-color photos throughout, <em>Natural Beekeeping </em>offers all the latest information in a book that has already proven invaluable for organic beekeepers.

Into the fray, Lucy Peppiatt offers her work on interpretation of the Bible and Christian practice. With careful exegetical work, Peppiatt considers relevant passages in Ephesians, Colossians, 1 Peter, 1 Timothy, and 1 Corinthians. There she finds a story of God releasing women alongside men into all forms of ministry, leadership, work, and service on the basis of character and gifting, rather than biological sex. Those who see the overturning of male-dominated hierarchy in the Scriptures, she argues, are truly rediscovering an ancient message&#x2015;a message distorted by those who assumed that a patriarchal world, which they sometimes saw reflected in the Bible, was the one God had ordained.</p><p>Lucy Peppiatt (PhD, Otago) is the principal of Westminster Theological Centre. Her research interests are Christ and the Spirit, charismatic theology, discipleship, and 1 Corinthians, and her books include <em>Unveiling Paul's Women</em> and <em>Women and Worship in Corinth</em>."I am so grateful to Lucy for this wonderful packaging of all her best ideas about women in the Bible and church." (From the foreword by Scot McKnight, professor of New Testament at Northern Seminary)<br><br>"The whole time I read this work, I kept thinking of those who would benefit from these thoughtful, accessible, and clearheaded responses to the primary objections against women fully serving in their gospel calling. Consequently, I am grateful for this resource that is both scripturally robust and theologically powerful. For those just beginning to think of these questions to those who have thought on these things for decades, Lucy's book will encourage and enlighten anyone who wants to engage these concerns." (Christa L. McKirland, executive director of Logia, Logos Institute Research Fellow, University of St. Andrews)<br><br>"Lucy Peppiatt has written an encouraging book that invites women to see themselves in the biblical story, not as props but as protagonists, and along the way she explains many of those confusing texts about wives, head coverings, and prohibitions on teaching. In the end, Peppiatt offers a biblically grounded case for Christian mutuality that unites the sexes in service of a common Lord." (Michael F. Bird, academic dean and lecturer in theology at Ridley College in Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Those who advocate for full equality between men and women in the home and the church are often accused of 'playing loose with Scripture.' Peppiatt debunks this myth by demonstrating how thoughtful, thorough engagement with the biblical text supports full mutuality. And this is nothing but good news for women! The introduction alone is worth the price of the book." (Gail Wallace, cofounder of The Junia Project, associate pastor, Foothill Free Methodist Church)<br><br>"As a woman in ministry and a local church pastor, I have studied what the Bible and scholarship has to say about women in ministry. But after reading Lucy's book, I realized I have only understood the tip of the iceberg. Insightful and inspiring, Lucy offers a fresh and full vision for a woman's role within the body of Christ&#x2015;a vision that is close to the heart of God and revealed in the pages of the Bible." (Tara Beth Leach, senior pastor of PazNaz, author of Emboldened)<br><br>"Scholarly yet accessible and offering intriguing insights into biblical texts, Lucy Peppiatt's new book engages with Hebrew and Greek, patristic and contemporary theological thought, and epigraphy and ancient documents, giving clear, coherent answers to questions we didn't even know how to ask. Eminently readable and easily lendable, I couldn't put it down." (Jill Firth, lecturer in Hebrew and Old Testament, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Debates about women, marriage, the Bible, and theology are explosive with heat, while often generating too little light. Peppiatt brings to the discussion wide-ranging knowledge, a keen exegetical eye, winsome and witty explanation, and new insights." (Nijay K. Gupta, associate professor of New Testament, Portland Seminary)<br><br>"We are encouraged in this volume to attend afresh to Scripture and to the vision Scripture offers of women and men called and gifted to share equally in the life of the church. Lucy Peppiatt shows that the leadership and witness of women is not merely allowed by Scripture but turns out to be an indispensable part of the biblical story of salvation. The wisdom shared with us in this book provides abundant evidence of the rich benefits that flow from listening to women as they guide us in the reading of God&#x2019;s Word." (Murray Rae, University of Otago)<br><br>"In her highly accessible and well-researched book, Lucy Peppiatt offers a clear hermeneutical vision for a 'mutualist' reading of the Bible. She closely analyzes controversial and debated biblical texts about women and men in leadership and marriage, while keeping in view the whole witness of Scripture and the revelation of God in Christ. One of the book's central tenets is that mutualist views of women are not new: women from the beginning have been part of God's story for humanity. Early church fathers, such as Augustine, also resisted hierarchical interpretations of the Bible that conceived of women as inherently inferior or spiritually subordinate to men. What is new about the book is how Peppiatt presents readers with the hermeneutical, exegetical, and theological considerations needed to challenge damaging theologies of female submission and promote women's God-given capacities for leadership, teaching, and ministry in the church. I strongly recommend this book for any student, seminarian, layperson, teacher, or pastor who desires to engage difficult biblical texts about women not in order to win debates but to envision more mutually empowering and God-glorifying ways both women and men can live into their identities as new creations in Christ."

Ok, associate professor of biblical studies, Azusa Pacific Seminary at Azusa Pacific University)</p><h2>Easy Steps to Chinese Vol.1, Workbook, Simplified Characters Version</h2><p>These are the companion workbooks for the Easy Steps to Chinese series.

Jackson. <p>With brilliantly objective scholarship, Jackson obliterates that picture in this book, and presents a picture of human heritage infinitely more rich, colorful, and varied than is generally understood. The book challenges all the standard approaches to African history and will, no doubt, disturb a large number of overnight "authorities" on Africa who will discover that they do not really know the depth of African history and the role that Africans played in creating early human societies. </p><p>Star-gods, moon-gods, sun gods, Osiris, the Zodiac, the lost continent of Atlantis--the impact of the myths and legends of ancient man upon human history is analyzed here. "Since the lore of astronomy and the calendar were the basis of much of the mythology, ritual, and religion of ancient Egypt, which in turn has profoundly affected all the great religious systems of later days," observes the author, "we deem it proper to discuss...these ancient African cults and creeds and their effects on other cultures." </p><p>In its panoramic view, from the dawn of prehistory to modern resurgent Africa, Introduction to African Civilizations challenges the parochial historian, devastates the theoretical pretensions of white supremacists, expands intellectual horizons. It is a fascinating book to be read and reread for pleasure and knowledge by the layman and the scholar. </p><p>"This is not just another book on African history. It is, in my opinion, one of the best books that has so far been written on the subject."--from the Introduction by John Henrik Clarke</p>Jackson was a highly respected historian and author. He lived and taught for many years in Chicago.<br><br>John Henrik Clarke was born in 1915 in Union Springs, Alabama, and was brought up in Columbus, Georgia. Editor, lecturer, writer, and teacher, Dr. Clarke lived in New York City from 1933 until his death in 1998.</p><h2>Pre-Accident Investigations: An Introduction to Organizational Safety</h2><p>Time-pressed, professionals looking for practical guidance to shape their current or future safety programs should use this book. <em>Pre-Accident Investigations: An Introduction to Organizational Safety</em> helps to identify complex potential incidents before they take place.

Written in an engaging, conversational style, around several case studies, the book is grounded in reality, with examples with which anyone can identify. It is an ideal aid for senior safety executives who want to spread the safety message among their colleagues. It is also an excellent choice for course tutors looking for a narrative-led primer.</p><p><strong>Todd Conklin</strong> is a Senior Advisor at Los Alamos National Laboratory, one of the world's foremost research and development laboratories, in the human performance and safety integration program.The concepts outlined in this absorbing book are eminently practical and have been tested in the field. Pre-Accident Investigations might well not only enhance safety but save organizations money - and potentially lives too. --The RoSPA Occupational Safety &amp; Health Journal, December 2012<br><br>'Conklin slaughters many holy cows in this very readable book, including the notion of cause , which he rejects as simply a retrospective construct. Workers don t cause failure; what workers do is trigger a whole lot of weaknesses that exist in environments, processes, systems, job sites, and in the work or organization itself. Conklin s ideas are persuasive, challenging, crystal clear, and expressed with humility and acknowledgement of what he has learned from others. --Safeguard, July/August 2013</p><h2>Red Star over the Pacific, Second Edition: China&#39;s Rise and the Challenge to U.S. Maritime Strategy</h2><p>Combining a close knowledge of Asia and an ability to tap Chinese-language sources with naval combat experience and expertise in sea-power theory, the authors assess how the rise of Chinese sea power will affect U.S. maritime strategy in Asia. They argue that China has laid the groundwork for a sustained challenge to American primacy in maritime Asia, and to defend this hypothesis they look back to Alfred Thayer Mahan&#39;s sea-power theories, now popular with the Chinese. The book considers how strategic thought about the sea shapes Beijing&#39;s deliberations and compares China&#39;s geostrategic predicament to that of the Kaiser&#39;s Germany a century ago. It examines the Chinese navy&#39;s operational concepts, tactics, and capabilities and appraises China&#39;s missile force. The authors conclude that China now presents a challenge to America&#39;s strategic position of such magnitude that Washington must compete in earnest.</p><p>TOSHI YOSHIHARA is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

The reasons why, if speculative, surely include our imminent environmental collapse and increasingly digitally mediated existence. <i>Landscape Painting Now</i> is the first book of its kind to take a global view of its subject, featuring more than eighty outstanding contemporary artists&#x2015;both established and emerging&#x2015;whose ages span seven decades and who hail from twenty-five different countries.<br><br>Through its thematic organization into six chapters&#x2015;Realism and Beyond, Post-Pop Landscapes, New Romanticism, Constructed Realities, Abstracted Topographies, and Complicated Vistas&#x2015;the book affords a generous window into the very best of contemporary landscape painting, from Cecily Brown&#x2019;s sensual, fleshy landscapes to Peter Doig&#x2019;s magic realist renderings of Trinidad, Maureen Gallace&#x2019;s serene views of beach cottages and the foaming ocean, David Hockney&#x2019;s radiant capturings of seasonal change in the English countryside, Julie Mehretu&#x2019;s dynamically cartographic abstractions, Alexis Rockman&#x2019;s mural-sized, postapocalyptic dioramas, and far beyond.<br><br><i>Landscape Painting Now</i> features an extensive essay by Barry Schwabsky, art critic for <i>The Nation</i>. Schwabsky&#x2019;s text weaves throughout the book, tracing the history of landscape painting from its origins in Eastern and Western art, through its transformation in the 20th century, to its present flourishing. Shorter texts by art historians Robert R. Shane, Louise S�rensen, and Susan A. Van Scoy introduce each artist, situating the importance of landscape within their practice and addressing key works.

The space is smaller, there&#x2019;s no grocery store 5 minutes away, you have fewer prepared foods and electric appliances, and food storage is much different. </p> <p>Despite cruising different oceans, we&#x2015;Jan and Carolyn--both faced the same challenges: eating well while having time to enjoy all the other great aspects of cruising. We love to snorkel, swim, kayak, explore&#x2015;and just sit and admire the view. </p> <p>We learned with the cookbooks we both had aboard, and wished for information that wasn't available--like when Jan ended up with a frozen chicken complete with head and feet and no instructions on how to cut it up. </p> <p>When we couldn't get foods such as sour cream, English muffins, spaghetti sauce or yogurt, we adapted recipes to make our own. Other times, we experimented with substituting ingredients--maybe the result wasn&#x2019;t identical, but it was still tasty. We ended up with over 150 substitutions and dozens of &#x201c;make it yourself&#x201d; options.

His extensive research combined with lucid prose provides readers a resource to better understand the foundations of Trinitarian reflection. The book is addressed to all who wish to benefit from an initiation to Trinitarian doctrine. </p><br><p> The path proposed by this introductory work comprises six steps. First the book indicates some liturgical and biblical ways for entering into Trinitarian faith. It then presents the revelation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the New Testament, by inviting the reader to reflect upon the signification of the word "God." Next it explores the confessions of Trinitarian faith, from the New Testament itself to the Creed of Constantinople, on which it offers a commentary. By emphasizing the Christian culture inherited from the fourth-century Fathers of the Church, the book presents the fundamental principles of Trinitarian doctrine, which find their summit in the Christian notion of "person."</p><br><p> On these foundations, the heart of the book is a synthetic exposition of the persons of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in their divine being and mutual relations, and in their action for us. Finally, the last step takes up again the study of the creative and saving action of the Trinity: the book concludes with a doctrinal exposition of the "missions" of the Son and Holy Spirit, that is, the salvific sending of the Son and Holy Spirit that leads humankind to the contemplation of the Father. </p><br><br><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p><br> <p>Gilles Emery, a Dominican priest of the Swiss province of Preachers, is professor of dogmatic theology at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.

When he bought the restaurant building in the centre of the village more than twenty-five years ago, he and his family rebuilt it entirely themselves. He is self-taught and has only ever worked in one kitchen &#x2013; his own &#x2013; where he designed and built his famous adjustable-height grills. With no other reference than the oldest culinary technique in the world &#x336; fire &#x336; he grills using utensils designed by himself, uses specific woods and has an obsessive search for the best product, Arginzoniz has revolutionized the way people roast meat, fish or vegetables. He cooks everything over a grill &#x336; even dessert &#x336; so everything has a unique taste to it. Michelin awarded Asador Etxebarri a Michelin star in 2010, describing the food as &#x2018;an unadulterated pleasure for lovers of simply grilled and roasted dishes...&#x2019; and he is ranked number 6 in the San Pellegrino World&#x2019;s 50 Best Restaurants 2017.<br>He rarely leaves the restaurant except to tend to his farm animals, which supply many of the raw ingredients for his tasting menu.

Saving Eutychus will help you save your listeners from such a fate. Written by an Aussie and an Irishman with very different styles who share a passion for preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, Saving Eutychus delivers fresh, honest, faithful and practical insights into preaching the whole word of God, Sunday by Sunday, without being dull.</p><p>Phil Campbell is senior pastor of Mitchelton Presbyterian Church (mpc.org.au) and lectures in preaching at Queensland Theological College (qtc.edu.au).

Everest. By the following year, three climbers -- a British poet and veteran of the Great War, a young French Chamonix guide, and an idealistic young American -- find a way to take their shot at the top. They arrange funding from the grieving Lady Bromley, whose son also disappeared on Mt. Everest in 1924. Young Bromley <em>must </em>be dead, but his mother refuses to believe it and pays the trio to bring him home. <br><br>Deep in Tibet and high on Everest, the three climbers -- joined by the missing boy's female cousin -- find themselves being pursued through the night by someone . . . or something. This nightmare becomes a matter of life and death at 28,000 feet - but what is pursuing them? And what is the truth behind the 1924 disappearances on Everest? As they fight their way to the top of the world, the friends uncover a secret far more abominable than any mythical creature could ever be. A pulse-pounding story of adventure and suspense, <em>The Abominable </em>is Dan Simmons at his spine-chilling best.</p><p>Dan Simmons is the award-winning author of several novels, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Olympos</em> and <em>The Terror</em>. He lives in Colorado.Even Jake Perry, the fictional travelogue author Dan Simmons meets in his latest novel, jokes that his reader may not make it through this endless stack of notebooks. But lovers of Simmons&amp;'s blend of alternate history, mystery, and myth will appreciate this three-act thriller set in the interwar years. Young American alpine climber Jake is invited on a recovery mission to find Percival Bromley, a British lord who vanished on Mt. Everest. Much of the novel is devoted to the strategies and techniques of mountain climbing as it was developing in the 1920s, and Jake, his friend Jean-Claude, and team leader Deacon spend a lot of time rubbing elbows and comparing gear with real alpinists of the era. But amid the wash of detail, Simmons plants crucial facts and conjectures about early-20th-century Europe that won&amp;'t pay off until Jake and his party are nearing the top of the world. Can murder and carnage be fully explained by the evil of men? Is a supernatural threat looming over the expedition? As usual, Simmons doesn&amp;'t answer all the questions he&amp;'s raised when the mysteries surrounding the loss of Percy Bromley are resolved, but his fans, like Jake, are sure to enjoy the journey.

A life of passion is a good life, or so we are told. But it's not that simple. Rarely is passion something that you just stumble upon, and&nbsp;the same drive that fuels breakthroughs--whether they're athletic, scientific, entrepreneurial, or artistic--can be every bit as destructive as it is&nbsp;productive. Yes, passion can be a wonderful gift, but only if you know how to channel it.

They ultimately argue that passion and balance--that other virtue touted by our culture--are incompatible, and that to find your passion, you must lose balance. And that's not always a bad thing. They show readers how to develop the <i>right </i>kind of passion, the kind that lets you achieve great things without ruining your life.

The world doesn&#x2019;t need any more gray. On the other hand, we can&#x2019;t get enough color. Mediocrity is nobody&#x2019;s goal, and perfection shouldn&#x2019;t be either. We&#x2019;ll never be perfect. But remember these three P&#x2019;s: Passion plus persistence equals possibility.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x2014;Jon Bon Jovi, 2001 commencement address, Monmouth University, West Long Branch, New Jersey1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Odds are, the passion described by Bon Jovi&#x2014;the wholehearted pursuit of an activity with enthusiasm, fire, and zeal&#x2014;is the kind with which you&#x2019;re familiar. It&#x2019;s celebrated widely and encouraged in nearly all settings, from the classroom to the workplace to the playing field. If you could just discover your passion and pursue it, the story goes, everything else will fall into place. But in reality, it doesn&#x2019;t always work like that. Even if you find a passion to pursue, you&#x2019;re probably not given much, if any, guidance on what happens next. While there are plenty of voices telling you to find your passion, there are hardly any telling you how to be passionate.</p><p>The seemingly straight line to success, happiness, and fulfillment that passion promises is almost always a more complicated route littered with potential wrong turns. In the words of Elon Musk, Silicon Valley mogul and founder of Tesla and SpaceX, &#x201c;The reality is great highs, terrible lows, and unrelenting stress.&#x201d;2 Consider just a few of the negative paths that passion can lead you down:&nbsp;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You become a slave to external results and validation. Following early success, the desire for more&#x2014;more money, more fame, more followers&#x2014;can easily take over. Your initial passion for doing an activity turns into a passion for achievement and results. You tie your self-worth to external validation, and the experience of a failure, or even just a plateau of moderate success, becomes devastating, rattling you to the core. Your enjoyment decreases (at best) and you become anxious, depressed, and unethical (at worst).</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You become blind to everything but your passion. You throw yourself so fully into a pursuit that you neglect everything outside it. Your marriage falls apart. Your children grow up without you realizing it. You ignore your health. You may feel good in the moment&#x2014;after all, you are consumed by something you love&#x2014;but years pass and you look back with regret on how you spent your time.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You burn out. Surrendering completely to passion may work for a day, a month, or even a year. But if left unchecked, most passions burn bright and burn short. It&#x2019;s not that you don&#x2019;t want to pace yourself, but simply that you can&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re far too overwhelmed by the acute pull of passion to realize the emotional and physical effort you are putting forth may be unsustainable. Before you know it, you run out of energy. What could have been a lifetime of passion and meaningful work instead looks more like a short bout of reckless excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You lose joy. There is also a risk that your passion&#x2019;s spark will dim slowly over time. A familiar story goes like this: You turn what started off as a wonderful hobby into a job (Blessed!); then you realize that what once was a wonderful hobby soon starts to feel like a job (This isn&#x2019;t what I thought it would be like); and it&#x2019;s not long before you start to question how something you once loved can seem like a chore (How on earth did this happen?). Though you never thought such a turn was possible, you come to dread your passion.</p><p><br>There is, of course, a different&#x2014;and far better&#x2014;kind of passion. It emerges when you become wrapped up in an activity primarily for the joy of doing the activity itself. When you experience success with humility and failure with temperate resolve. When your goal becomes your path and your path becomes your goal. When your passion is fueled by deep purpose and is in harmony with the rest of your life. When you practice mindful self-awareness to pierce through the tidal inertia that passion can create, giving you control over your passion so your passion doesn&#x2019;t control you. When you feel alive not just for a few months or years but for an entire career or lifetime. This is the passion we all crave. This is the best kind of passion.</p><p>Almost all passions begin as enthusiastic pursuits. No one wants to burn out, throw their lives out of balance, or lose joy. Passion&#x2019;s positive and negative paths&#x2014;the good and bad kind of passion&#x2014;arise from the same place; it&#x2019;s just that if you don&#x2019;t proactively prevent passion from veering off course, it&#x2019;s likely to do so, oftentimes without you even realizing it. Put differently, passion is fragile, and it must be handled with care. This is why research shows that passion isn&#x2019;t just linked to happiness, health, performance, and life satisfaction, but also to anxiety, depression, burnout, and unethical behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Though lots has been written on how to find your passion, much of it is misguided, rife with clich�s while short on evidence. And, as you&#x2019;re starting to see, finding your passion is only half the battle anyway. Knowing how to sustain and channel it in a productive and healthy manner is the other&#x2014;and equally important&#x2014;half. Unfortunately, that half is rarely, if ever, discussed. As a result, far too often passion goes awry and people suffer from some version of the negative repercussions described above. This book aims to change that. To show you how you can find and cultivate passion and how you can manage its immense power for good. We&#x2019;ll show you that what direction your passion takes is a choice, not a predetermined destiny. We&#x2019;ll give you practical tools to ensure that your passion burns bright, long, and in harmony with the rest of your life. And we&#x2019;ll do this without using trite clich�s that dominate so many other books about this topic. We&#x2019;ll be authentic and honest, bringing to bear not only the latest scientific evidence but also the thinking of some of the world&#x2019;s most considerate poets and philosophers.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to achieve this goal, we&#x2019;ll undergo a thorough exploration of passion. We&#x2019;ll examine both the biological and psychological drivers that give rise to passion, as well as the stories of extraordinarily passionate individuals. Some of these stories will be positive, like those of Olympic swimming star Katie Ledecky and investor Warren Buffett; others will be cautionary tales, like those of the fraudulent businessman Jeffrey Skilling of Enron and baseball cheat Barry Bonds. We&#x2019;ll question the merits of living a &#x201c;balanced&#x201d; life, explore how self-awareness prevents future regret, and discuss the importance of the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves. We&#x2019;ll learn that passion is not an emotion that should be left to its own devices but rather one that should be harnessed with deliberate intention. But before we do any of that, in order to lay the groundwork for how we can live with the best kind of passion, we must first gain an understanding of its roots. We&#x2019;ll start by traveling back in time to a distant yesterday, when the notion of passion first emerged.</p><p>Passion Practices<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone tells us to find our passion but no one tells us how to find it, let alone how to live with it.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While most passions start off as positive endeavors, they often take turns for the worse.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don&#x2019;t proactively manage your passion, you put yourself at risk for:<br>&#x2212;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming a slave to external validation and results.<br>&#x2212;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burnout.<br>&#x2212;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regret.<br>&#x2212;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loss of joy.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do proactively manage your passion, however, living with passion leads to improved health, happiness, and overall life-satisfaction.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, there is both good passion and bad passion. And what direction your passion takes is largely up to you.<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; C.

Even as butterflies ominously proliferate in town, the rumor of a mysterious creature lurking in the tunnel behind the school spreads among the children. When the body of Arié Kimura�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s mother is found by this tunnel�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s entrance, next to apparently human traces, the legend seems to be confirmed. Is the end of the world coming? In order to appease the wrath of the beast, the children decide to offer it a sacrifice: The unfortunate Arié, whom they believe to be the cause of the curse, is shoved into a well that leads to the Nijigahara tunnel �&#x20ac;&#x201d; an act that in turns pushes Komatsuzaki, the budding thug who has carried a torch for Arié for a while already, entirely over the edge. But this is only the beginning of the complex, challenging, obliquely told Nijigahara Holograph, which takes place in two separate timelines and involves the suicidal Suzuki; Higure, his stalkerish would-be girlfriend; and their teacher Miss Sakaki, whose heavily bandaged face remains a mystery; and many more �&#x20ac;&#x201d; brothers, sisters, parents, co-workers, teachers, aggressors and victims who are all inextricably linked to one another and all will eventually �&#x20ac;&#x201d; ten years later �&#x20ac;&#x201d; have to live with what they�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve done or suffered through.</p><p><p>INIO ASANO was born in 1980 in the Ibaraki Prefecture.

Her translations include the <em>New York Times</em> Best-Seller <em>Nijigahara Holograph</em> by Inio Asano and Hayao Miyazaki&#x2019;s <em>Nausica� of the Valley of the Wind</em>.</p>*Starred Review* A mother commits suicide. A bully keeps watch over a victim. A teacher withdraws from her students. An obsessed man weaves a tale of monsters. By shifting time and perspective, Asano is able to fit all of these puzzle pieces together to create a haunting story of trauma, guilt, and, finally, closure. At the heart of the tale is Ari�, who tells one too many stories about the monster that lives in the tunnel behind the school. In an attempt to shut her up, her classmates push her into a well. The consequences of that action spiral outward in ways the children never imagined, affecting friends, family, teachers, and neighbors in ways the children never imagined, horrifically affecting friends, family, teachers, and neighbors, both physically and psychologically. Anger, hopelessness, and betrayal run rampant&#x2014;echoed by the eerie, ominous clouds of butterflies swarming the town&#x2014;and fuel heartless violence. Though there are many moving pieces, the fluid time line; tight, stark, and realistic artwork; and clues carefully revealed through deliberately worded dialogue and purposeful character design work in perfect harmony to prevent ambiguity or confusion. Critically acclaimed Asano deftly twists this disturbingly compelling story, managing to shock the reader at every turn. Its intricacies are even more rewarding on the second read. --Eva Volin</p><h2>Tilda Sewing By Heart: For the love of fabrics</h2><p><b>Fall in love with this heartfelt sewing pattern collection from fabric designer Tone Finnanger.</b><br><br> In this glorious celebration of her passion for fabric, Tone shares over 20 sewing, patchwork, applique and quilting projects that will bring colour and beauty to your home.<br><br> Projects include stunning quilts, pretty pillows, sophisticated soft toys and beautiful accessories--all designed with characteristic Tilda charm.<br><br> Featuring gorgeous photography, in-depth instructions and full-size templates, you'll soon be sewing by heart.</p><p>Tone Finnanger is the founder and sole designer of the internationally recognised Tilda brand, which she started in 1999 at the age of 25.

According to the account of Ruby Morris, it's a lot harder than one might think: Ruby hails from the wet and dreary United Kingdom. After an imminent meteor strike is avoided, events lead to an alien bacterium-laced rain that is fatal and contagious. Stranded and devoid of any parental guidance, Ruby must cross vast distances and make choices even when no right answer exists. The first-person narrative allows for a unique perspective.

When she pictured an American life for herself, she dreamed of a life like Aimee and Amber's, the title characters of her favorite American TV show. She never pictured fleeing her home in El Salvador under threat of death and stealing across the US border as "an illegal", but after her brother is murdered and her younger sister, Gabi's, life is also placed in equal jeopardy, she has no choice, especially because she knows everything is her fault. If she had never fallen for the charms of a beautiful girl named Liliana, Pablo might still be alive, her mother wouldn't be in hiding and she and Gabi wouldn't have been caught crossing the border.<br> <br>But they have been caught and their asylum request will most certainly be denied. With truly no options remaining, Marisol jumps at an unusual opportunity to stay in the United States. She's asked to become a grief keeper, taking the grief of another into her own body to save a life. It's a risky, experimental study, but if it means Marisol can keep her sister safe, she will risk anything. She just never imagined one of the risks would be falling in love, a love that may even be powerful enough to finally help her face her own crushing grief.<br> <br>The Grief Keeper is a tender tale that explores the heartbreak and consequences of when both love and human beings are branded illegal.</p><p>Alexandra Villasante has always loved telling stories--though not always with words.

The two guards are talking. Not looking at us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Priceless</i> means it&#x2019;s so valuable, you can&#x2019;t pay for it. You can&#x2019;t replace it. Ever.&#x201d; Like you, I think, then wish I hadn&#x2019;t. If I let myself worry about how little I can protect Gabi, I will scream.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make any sense. Why did that guard say a joke was priceless?&#x201d; She points to one of the guards, and I immediately push her hand down. I don&#x2019;t want their attention on us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I say distractedly. Lunch is almost over. We eat fast so we can have a few minutes together before Gabi goes to her classes and I go to mine. She&#x2019;s in an advanced class because she knows so much English. I sit alone with a guard in a small room meant for babies because there is no one else here in my grade. The guard gives me worksheets to do and books to read. I never take the ones in Spanish. I want to show her, and the people I know are watching on the video cameras mounted on the thin walls, how good an American I can be. The guard doesn&#x2019;t let me use the computer.<br> &nbsp;<br> But today is different. After I take Gabi to her class in one of the trailers parked inside the walled courtyard, my guard&#x2014;her name tag says REYNOLDS&#x2014;takes me through the longer hallways that lead, I think, to the exit. I panic a little, thinking that they will push me out the door, or take me somewhere without Gabi. I take a deep breath and tell myself to steady my voice. I want to be respectful and not show fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where are we going, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; I ask Reynolds.<br> &nbsp;<br> She slows her stride and looks at me with an expression that seems to say, <i>I forgot you could talk</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your interview,&#x201d; she says curtly before picking up her pace again. I knew it was coming. The first night at the border, I knew to say we were asking for asylum. Now they want to know why, to ask questions. I&#x2019;m ready. I have the right answers. I pat the front pocket of my jeans, find the envelope where it has been since the day we left home, then hurry to catch up with Reynolds.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reynolds doesn&#x2019;t interview me, but she does guard the door. I sit at one of the chairs at a small table and wait. There&#x2019;s nothing personal in the room. Not a plant or a picture or even a cup with a funny design. It&#x2019;s a room that doesn&#x2019;t give anything away.<br> &nbsp;<br> A woman in a business suit, tall like my t�a Rosa and with a messy blond bun, bustles in and sits across from me. I love the word <i>bustle</i> because there isn&#x2019;t a word exactly like it in Spanish.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My name is Mary Schoenbeck. You can call me Mary. I will be conducting your interview. Do you need an interpreter?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If I needed an interpreter, how would I understand her enough to ask for one? There was a time when I thought I could be an interpreter, working for the government or the UN. Now I only want us to be allowed to stay.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am. I speak English fluently.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This surprises the woman enough that she looks up from her stack of folders. &#x201c;Good. That makes my job easier. Your name is Marisol Morales, correct?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I nod.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please speak your answers aloud,&#x201d; she says, pointing to a recording device on the table. <br> &nbsp;<br> I clear my throat. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Marisol Morales, this is what is called a credible fear interview. You have claimed that you are seeking asylum in the United States of America due to your belief that you are in physical danger of torture or death.&#x201d; She barely takes a second to breathe. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re seventeen, correct?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. March. Twenty-seven.&#x201d; I spent my birthday somewhere between Guatemala and Mexico. Even Gabi forgot to say feliz cumple.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right. Tell me, in your own words, why are you seeking asylum in the United States?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>My words</i>. My words want to jump out of my mouth, out of my heart. I have been keeping them inside for weeks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We.&#x201d; I stop. Then start again. &#x201c;My brother, Pablo, was forced to join a gang. La Mara Salvatrucha.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though the recording device is on, Mrs. Schoenbeck scribbles in her notebook.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After that, our father was threatened. He had to pay money.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Even though your brother was in the gang?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I stare at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I mean, wouldn&#x2019;t he get some kind of break? A sort of discount for friends and family?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I look into her eyes to check if this is a joke I don&#x2019;t understand. But I don&#x2019;t see a smile on Mrs. Schoenbeck&#x2019;s face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a different gang. Barrio 18.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; she says, like she thinks that I am lying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is nothing like a break for friends or family. When Pap� could no longer pay, he went to San Salvador to find better work. He used to work at the Pepsi factory.&#x201d; Before he was fired in disgrace for coming to work drunk. Before he gambled and drank and wasted away all our lives. T�a Rosa said not to mention that.<br> &nbsp;<br> I keep going with my story. It&#x2019;s a map to follow&#x2014;first one place to land, then another. I follow the story so I don&#x2019;t get lost. &#x201c;He was gone for two weeks. Then we got a letter that said he would not be coming back. And if we did not pay his debts, we would see trouble.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who was the letter from?&#x201d; Mrs. Schoenbeck asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shrug. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t signed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you have it with you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. Mam� burned it. And all the other ones.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How many were there? Can you remember?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There were five.&#x201d; Pablo said not to worry. It was Barrio. Salvatrucha would take care of it. He and Antonio, Tato y El Negro, and all the others would protect us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what did you think that meant?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought Barrio meant to hurt us. To kill us if we didn&#x2019;t give them money.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But why? Why you specifically?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Follow the story. Follow the map. &#x201c;Because my father was in debt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mary Schoenbeck rubs the back of her neck, and suddenly I want to do the same, to release the tension from my neck and shoulders. I didn&#x2019;t even realize I was hunched forward. I sit a little straighter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, this was extortion. Nothing personal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I feel sick. Every word she pulls out of me makes my throat ache. &#x201c;Can I have some water?&#x201d; I ask. That&#x2019;s something you can do when you don&#x2019;t know what else to do with your hands. Hold a glass of water. Reynolds leaves the room and almost immediately comes back with a cold bottle of water.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say after a long gulp. &#x201c;If we didn&#x2019;t pay, Barrio would kill us.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m glad Gabi isn&#x2019;t here. I&#x2019;m not sure she could stick to the story. I would be worried about it coming out the wrong way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Schoenbeck reads over her notes, flipping the pages back, then forward again. &#x201c;So, um. Your father is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. missing? Dead?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shake my head, then shrug. Mam� thinks Pap� left us. That he has saved himself, a selfish man who abandoned his family. But I think he was <i>made</i> to disappear, like a terrible magic trick.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. He never came back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t know where he is?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; She takes out the forms I completed when we arrived in Pennsylvania, four days ago. The I-589 form that asks for asylum. She writes a note in the margin of the first page. I wish I could read upside down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Schoenbeck circles her fingers in the air, a sign to continue. &#x201c;Go ahead. Your father disappeared&#x2014;mysterious circumstances.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. Then Pablo got in trouble with the leader of his gang, Antonio.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sits up, her eyes catching mine. &#x201c;Got in trouble how?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I squirm. I know I have to stay with the story. But it&#x2019;s so difficult talking about this part. It is the most difficult part. The least true part.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because Pablo wanted his girlfriend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whose girlfriend?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Antonio&#x2019;s girlfriend. Liliana.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, okay, so there was a love triangle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mary Schoenbeck exhales loudly. &#x201c;So, first there was a gang&#x2014;Barrio 18&#x2014;that threatened you because of your father&#x2019;s debts. Then another gang&#x2019;s leader, Antonio, was upset because of a girlfriend. And that&#x2019;s why he threatened you and your family?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The way she talks about it makes it seem so silly, so small. &#x201c;Yes. We got death threats.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What kind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Notes on the door. Strangers coming up to my mother on the street, telling her to watch out. One time, a window was broken at the salon where Mam� and I worked.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I close my eyes for a moment and see the image of my mother wringing out the sponge in the bucket, scrubbing at the words painted on the side of our house: <i>�Putas de mierda!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go back a bit,&#x201d; Mrs. Schoenbeck says. &#x201c;What was the date your father disappeared?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I am suddenly so tired that I want to cry, which is useless. Tears can&#x2019;t help us. I answer all her questions, though she repeats them using different words two or three times. I answer her like I am a machine. All the dates I had practiced with T�a Rosa, the map I have to follow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And what was the date that you were detained?&#x201d; I snap my attention back to Mrs. Schoenbeck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>We</i> were detained,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stops writing and looks up. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We. I am here with my sister, Gabriela. I&#x2019;m her guardian. In loco parentis,&#x201d; I say. I immediately wish I hadn&#x2019;t. If she knows that means<i> in the place of a parent</i> in Latin, then she thinks I&#x2019;m showing off. If she doesn&#x2019;t know what it means, then she&#x2019;ll hate me for knowing something she doesn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, I understand.&#x201d; She scribbles more notes. &#x201c;What about Pablo. Why didn&#x2019;t he come with you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her question, even though I expected it, makes me pause. I don&#x2019;t think of my brother. That is the rule I made. Pablo&#x2019;s memory weighs on me, all the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He was killed. By the gang. It&#x2019;s only Gabi and me now.&#x201d; I push down the urge to say &#x201c;Gabi and I&#x201d; because sounding the way real people talk is important in learning a new language. I learned a lot from watching satellite TV in Mrs. Rosen&#x2019;s kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where is your mother?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She is staying with my t�a Rosa. Rosa Morales. A hidden place north of San Miguel.&#x201d; <i>I am too slow, mijita. I cannot keep up with you and Gabriela. I will stay with Rosa until it is safe to leave. Then I will make my way to Mrs. Rosen&#x2019;s house. We will be together again, te lo juro.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> After more questions that go in circles, Mrs. Schoenbeck puts down her pen, folds her hands, and leans forward. This is the moment.</p><h2>Finding Claire Fletcher (A Claire Fletcher and Detective Parks Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p><b>In the first book in bestselling author Lisa Regan&#x2019;s new series, a one-night stand sets a detective on the trail of a terrifying unsolved crime.</b></p><p>With his career on thin ice and fresh ink on his divorce papers, Sacramento PD Detective Connor Parks goes searching for solace at the bottom of a bottle...and winds up in the arms of a beautiful woman.

With his passion for surfing uniting many narratives, he intertwines his own story with those of some of the great heroes of surf in a rare work of nonfiction that is as moving as it is fascinating.</p><p>AJ Dungo is an illustrator from Florida. He studied at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and his work has been shown in several group exhibitions in New York and LA. His work strives to create interesting atmospheres and feelings that viewers can have a reaction to. He lives in LA."I love this book deeply.&nbsp;AJ writes and draws like a surfer, with such fluidity, grace, and breathability, managing to flow with the most profound love and loss, without it dragging us under. He surrenders to the infinite power and mystery of the ocean to heal the void within . . .&nbsp;this book is a clean line that glides, rolls, and truly moves you.&nbsp;Currently my favorite graphic novel in the universe."<br><b>&#x2014;Craig Thompson, Eisner award winning author of the bestselling <i>Blankets</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Nature is massive: Human forms are diminutive when measured against Dungo&#x2019;s spare representations of starry skylines, butterflies, mountain ranges and, primarily, the ocean, a striking and dense blue against the panels&#x2019; abundant white space. [...] On two-page spreads that recall Raymond Pettibon&#x2019;s mesmerizing large-scale paintings of Hermosa Beach&#x2019;s wave riders, Dungo is engulfed by marble seawater, its dark swirls more closely resembling snaking wood grain than they do any ocean.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Dominic Umile, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></b> <br><br>"While 'In Waves' packs an emotional punch, Dungo avoids sentimentality and is careful not to miscast the ocean as some soppy metaphor for salvation. The book seems to argue that life and death are what they are, and riding waves is no shortcut to health or happiness&#x2014;it can, however, provide momentary escape, a temporary shelter, a kind of peace. As Dungo states, loss often leaves us alone 'with only water to comfort.'"<br><b>&#x2014;Steve van Rees, <i>Surfer</i>&nbsp;magazine</b><br><br>&#x201c;Dungo tells these stories with a sure hand, weaving time lines and seemingly disparate elements into a rich, cohesive tale. The simply drawn illustrations are elegant and economical but deeply powerful . . . A beautiful tribute to first love and living life to its absolute fullest.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>"Part memoir and part history book,&nbsp;A.J. Dungo&nbsp;brings both together in a tender examination of grief and healing for his debut graphic novel&nbsp;In Waves, finding the connections between the two focuses of his interest and emotion and uncovering how all these part can work to keep him going."<br> &#x2014;<b>The Beat<br></b><br>&#x201c;Always interesting when something is at once terribly sad and gorgeously life-affirming. A.J. Dungo&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>In Waves&nbsp;</i>is exactly that. [...] It&#x2019;s heartfelt and it&#x2019;s heartbreaking. And it&#x2019;s so beautiful.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Jamie Brisick, author of&nbsp;<i>Becoming Westerly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The muted color scheme alternates aquamarine with seashell peach. Through sweeping two-page spreads showing the texture of waves in decorative, woodlike patterns and through quiet interludes following Kristen&#x2019;s ultimately tragic story, Dungo presents an evocative tone poem that celebrates the spirit of a young woman who clings to experience as tenaciously as a surfer riding high.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly<br><br></i></b>"Dungo delineates his characters -- their faces often turned away from the reader like Downwind from the Smilin'&nbsp;Jack&nbsp;comic strip -- dwarfed by swirling, striped waves, austere urban landscapes and sometimes even just inky blackness, efficiently conveying the sense of helplessness and sorrow that comes when confronted with terminal illness.&nbsp;I also like the way Dungo draws his figures, loose and slightly rubbery, with a minimal amount of facial details, as though they might melt if they got too close to a heated surface."<br><b>&#x2014;Chris Mautner, <i>The Comics Journal</i></b></p><h2>The Nine Doors of Midgard: A Curriculum of Rune-work</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>The Nine Doors of Midgard</em> are the gateways to self-transformation and mastery through the Runes. This complete course of study and practice has been used by the initiates of the Rune-Gild since 1980. Long out-of-print to the wider public and difficult to obtain, it is now being made available in a completely revised and updated fifth edition.&nbsp;The Runic Tradition represents a whole school of inner work as ancient as any other and with the added importance that it is the ancestral, or natural, path for folks of Germanic (English, German, Dutch, and Scandinavian) background. The graded steps of <em>The Nine Doors of Midgard</em> are the only curriculum to take a systematic and traditional approach to inner Rune-work.&nbsp;Through nine &#x201c;lessons&#x201d; the book takes the Rune-worker from a stage in which no previous knowledge of Runes or esoteric work is assumed to a high level of initiation.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Edred Thorsson (pen name of Stephen E. Flowers) founded the Rune-Gild in 1980. It is the only traditional initiatory organization that employs the Runic key to personal and cultural development. Edred received his Ph.D. in 1984 with a dissertation entitled Runes and Magic. He has subsequently authored over forty books on topics of runology, Germanic myth and tradition, and Indo-European religion and culture."This new fifth edition of Edred Thorsson's The Nine Doors of Midgard, finely detailed with explanations and illustrative diagrams, is undoubtedly the most comprehensive course of rune practice that exists. Based upon the twenty-four runes of the Elder Futhark, The Nine Doors of Midgard is a practical exposition of the underlying principles of Germanic esoteric lore. The runes embody the hidden principles of everything in existence, and The Nine Doors of Midgard gives the reader and participant access to the inner workings of human consciousness and our place in the cosmos." -Nigel Pennick, author of many works on European traditions including Pagan Magic of the Northern Tradition, The Book of Primal Signs, and Magical Alphabets<br><br>&nbsp;"Dr. Stephen Flowers is, without question, the most important contemporary writer on the Nordic Mystery Tradition. For more than four decades he has explored the secrets of the runes and Norse magic in theory and practice. He is always faithful to the historical sources, but at the same time innovatively adapts the old wisdom to the needs of the present day. Another important feature of Stephen Flowers's work is that he-like Odin-does not shy away from the dark or controversial, but guides the seeker to discover the runic secrets in all of their manifold meaning. This new edition of The Nine Doors of Midgard will be welcomed by scholars and practitioners of the Nordic Tradition alike." -Thomas Karlsson, Ph.D., founder of Dragon Rouge; author of Uthark: Nightside of the Runes and Adulruna and the Gothic Cabala<br><br>&nbsp;"The Runes, like the Hebrew letters, have always been seen not just as an alphabet but as a set of glyphs representing cosmic principles and different forms of energy. For those who wish to opt for the Runes as a system of personal development, this book provides a carefully thought-out curriculum, involving ritual practice, meditation, and more. Edred Thorsson stands in the tradition of a succession of runologists who, since the late nineteenth century, have continued to reinterpret and re-apply the Runes within a changing world." -Christopher McIntosh, author of Eliphas Levi and the French Occult Revival, The Swan King: Ludwig II of Bavaria, and Gardens of the Gods<br><br>&nbsp;"Edred Thorsson offers the reader a complete paradigm of magic, rooted in the deep cultural soil of northwestern Europe. Informed by his expert understanding of linguistics and enriched by material culled from historical sources, our author has developed a comprehensive curriculum for those who wish to engage with the Mystery. From metaphysical theory to results-magic, The Nine Doors of Midgard is an essential text for serious students of the Runes and the Germanic tradition." -Julian Vayne, co-author, The Book of Baphomet<br><br>&nbsp;"This new edition of The Nine Doors of Midgard provides those interested in the runes with a plethora of techniques and source materials, which are fascinating and useful in their own right in addition to forming the basic programme of work required to join the Rune-Gild. The style of the text is very much Edred's own, yet the material is presented with the emphasis on the reader/runer gaining her own understanding by direct work. This is a thorough explanation of the current study of runic mysteries." -Nikki Wyrd, co-author, The Book of Baphomet</p>
